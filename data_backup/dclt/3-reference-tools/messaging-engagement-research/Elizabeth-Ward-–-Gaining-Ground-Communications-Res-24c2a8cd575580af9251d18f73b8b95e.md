### **Overview**

Elizabeth Ward presented research and message strategy for the *Gaining Ground* campaign, focusing on **water quality messaging** and **audience-first communications** for land trusts.

---

## **Key Communications Principles (“Truisms”)**

1. **Always start with the audience** – Focus on those most likely to support you.
2. **You are not the audience** – Motivators differ from your own.
3. **Context matters** – Ask the right comparative questions to reveal true priorities.

## **Research Highlights**

### **1. Public Support Trends**

- **Western voters prefer conservation over energy development** on national public lands, growing from 65% in 2019 to **72% in 2025** (Slide 1, FM3 Research).
- **95% total support** for voluntary, permanent land conservation agreements across all parties:
    - GOP: 95% (61% strongly support)
    - IND: 95% (55% strongly support)
    - DEM: 96% (60% strongly support)
        
        *(Slides 6 & 8)*

### **2. Nature Affinity**

- 79% agree certain nature smells/sounds bring happy memories.
- 61% say love of nature is one of their strongest feelings.
- 47% enjoy nature more than anything else.
- **44% also say other issues take priority over nature/wildlife** (Slide 10 – key competing priorities stat).

### **3. Water as #1 Concern**

Gallup March 2025 – % “Worry a great deal”:

- Pollution of drinking water: 54%
- Pollution of rivers/lakes/reservoirs: 51%
- Air pollution: 40%
- Climate change/global warming: 40%
    
    *(Slide 7)*
    

---

### **4. Protection Appetite**

- 40% say we need to protect **a lot more** land/water/wildlife habitat.
- 52% say we’ve made progress but need to do more.
- Only 9% say we’ve done enough.
    
    *(Slide 4)*
    

---

### **5. Bipartisan & Ballot Strength**

- 2024 election: 66% of Republicans and Democrats in 13 states voted for conservation/climate proposals, generating **$18B** in funding.
- Ballot measure success often linked to **water-focused messaging** (Slide 3).

---

## **Audience Segmentation**

**High Prospects (“Cereal Eaters”)** – ~33M Americans

- Younger (esp. Millennials), diverse (Latinx & Black over-representation), urban/suburban, high-income, college-educated, likely have kids.
- Strong emotional connection to conservation; willing to act even without direct personal benefit.
- Likely to vote; digital natives.

**Moderate Prospects (“Scrambled Eggs Eaters”)**

- Older, rural, transactional view (support tied to personal benefit).
- Less emotionally driven; require different messaging.

---

## **Message Testing – Most Compelling Reasons to Support Land Trusts**

1. **Permanent protection for future generations** *(#1 reason)*
2. **Equal access** to clean air, clean water, land for all.
3. **Forests/natural areas absorb pollution** (climate framing).
4. **Direct climate change mitigation** (when locally acceptable).
5. **Improving health**, **protecting cultural sites**, **bringing communities together**.
6. Support not dependent on personal use/visitation of the protected land.

---

## **Language & Framing Insights**

- High-impact phrases: “Protecting habitat for plants and animals,” “clean water,” “healthy communities,” “nature preserves,” “walking in nature” (less gear-exclusive than “hiking”).
- Avoid jargon (“conservation easement”) with public; use “voluntary, permanent land protection.”
- Climate language: adapt to local norms (“extreme weather” or “pollution in the air” can substitute).

---

## **Strategic Implications**

- **Lead with water** – universal, bipartisan, high-urgency entry point.
- **Position conservation as a solution** to audience-priority issues (health, safety, legacy, climate resilience).
- **Leverage bipartisan strength** in advocacy and donor outreach.
- **Integrate numbers visually** in materials for credibility (e.g., “95% bipartisan support”).
- Build **community + purpose** framing to align with research on lasting happiness.

## **Action Steps for DCLT**

1. **Incorporate hard stats** from FM3/Gallup in key messaging (“72% prioritize conservation over energy development”).
2. **Water-first framing** in campaigns, paired with health/community benefits.
3. **Target High Prospects** with digital storytelling, peer actions, and values-driven copy.
4. **Adapt climate messaging** per audience comfort (direct or indirect framing).
5. Cross-link these tested phrases to **Key Messaging Database** for easy reuse.
