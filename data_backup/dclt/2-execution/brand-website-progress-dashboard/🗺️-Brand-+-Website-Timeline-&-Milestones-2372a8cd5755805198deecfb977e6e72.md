# **✅ Project Roadmap Summary**

## **1. Brand Identity Overhaul**

**Goal:** Redefine DCLT’s visual and verbal identity to reflect mission, values, and evolving audience needs.

### **📅 Timeline (July 2025 – February 2026)**

| **Phase** | **Dates** | **Milestones** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Phase 1: Discovery & Audit** | Jul–Aug 2025 | ✅ Brand Audit Complete🔜 Define Brand Personality |
| **Phase 2: Design Development** | Aug–Oct 2025 | 🔜 Finalize Logo & System🔜 Draft Guidelines🔜 Create Templates & Icon Set |

### **🔑 Key Milestones**

- 🔜 Publish brand guidelines

### **📌 Immediate Next Steps**

- Define Brand Personality (tone, voice, emotional resonance)
- Begin logo finalization and testing once Focus Groups are finished
- Draft early brand system components (color, typography, iconography)

## **🎨 Mission-Aligned Design Approach**

As we move from discovery to execution, our design process will be rooted in **authentic community insights** and **organizational values**.

We’ll use focus group findings to surface the emotional and visual themes that matter most to our audiences — and cross-reference those with DCLT’s own mission, values, and beliefs.

### **🧭 How We’ll Guide Creative Decisions:**

- **Synthesize feedback** from all generational focus groups (emotional tone, visual preferences, language resonance)
- **Map values overlap** between audience feedback and DCLT’s mission:
    - Protection of land and water
    - Community connection and stewardship
    - Legacy, authenticity, and access
- **Define 3–5 brand attributes** to guide design (e.g., *Rooted, Inviting, Enduring, Clear, Natural*)

### **🎯 Design System Principles**

We’ll ask of every visual and verbal decision:

- Does this reflect *who we are* and *who we serve*?
- Is it emotionally resonant *and* clearly legible?
- Does it feel like **Door County**, not just any land trust?
- Can this scale across platforms and generations?

> The result will be a system that’s
> 
> 
> *values-aligned, story-driven,*
> 

## 🧭 Brand Governance & Decision Framework

To keep the rebrand process inclusive yet focused, we’ve defined clear roles, guardrails, and decision points.

### 🔐 Decision-Making Core

A small decision-making group will review and approve major milestones:

- **Communications Manager (Lead):** Owns brand strategy, synthesis, and direction
- **Development Director**: Ensures brand alignment with organizational vision, values, and long-term positioning
- **Executive Director:** Ensures alignment with organizational vision and donors
- **Non-profit strategist volunteer:** Provides branding and engagement perspective from the nonprofit sector; reviews strategic framing and materials
- **Communications Coordinator (Designer):** Executes visual assets and design system components; collaborates on templates, iconography, and digital rollout

This group signs off on:

- Brand personality and tone
- Logo and visual system
- Messaging pillars
- Rollout strategy

## **👥  Roles & Division of Labor**

| **Role** | **Responsibilities** |
| --- | --- |
| **Comms Manager** | Leads brand development, owns Notion system, creates messaging framework, synthesizes focus group data, and sets design direction |
| **Comms Coordinator** | Leads visual system execution, co-develops messaging, manages creative assets/templates |
| **Development Director** | Reviews language and design through donor lens; ensures legacy and philanthropic audiences are represented in tone, voice, and priorities |
| **Strategist Volunteer** | Advises on structure, inclusivity, and nonprofit best practices; reviews at milestone checkpoints |

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Stakeholder Engagement

We are building for *alignment, not consensus.* Community voices shape the work, but don't vote on visual details.

Engagement tools include:

- Focus groups (legacy + newer audiences)
- Staff pulse-checks
- Select donor and volunteer input
- Internal preview + feedback window

## 📌 Division of Roles

| Role | Responsibilities |
| --- | --- |
| **Comms Manager** | Leads strategy, coordinates decision-making, defines visual tone and brand framework |
| **Comms Coordinator** | Executes tasks: documentation, Notion updates, asset prep, presentation support, web/social rollout |
| **Designer** | Develops logo, templates, and brand system in alignment with research |
| **ED/Board** | Approves strategic direction, provides donor/stakeholder lens, avoids micromanaging design |

## 🛠️ Tools & Templates In Progress

- Brand Strategy Doc (values, tone, narrative)
- Stakeholder FAQ
- Brand Rollout Plan (audience-specific)
- Feedback protocols and version control

## **🤝 Creative Collaboration Notes**

> The Communications Manager and Communications Coordinator work as creative co-leads:
> 
- **Strategy + Systems** (Manager)
- **Design + Execution**  + **Messaging** (Coordinator)

> Regular milestone reviews ensure alignment, and all visual decisions are made collaboratively with space for both vision and feedback.
> 

## **🔀 Brand Decision Path: Internal Review vs. External Validation**

As we near the final phase of brand system development (logo, type, color, voice), we face a fork in the road. There are two valid paths forward, depending on the boldness of our creative direction and how much validation we want before rollout.

## **✅ Recommended Brand Validation Plan**

*(Finalizing DCLT’s Visual Identity System)*

This phase bridges internal leadership decision-making with a brief round of supporter sense-checking to confirm alignment and surface any late-stage objections.

---

## **🧩 Core Internal Review**

**Primary Decision-Making Group**

**Participants:**

- **Communications Manager** – strategic lead & facilitator
- **Communications Coordinator** – co-designer & messaging partner
- **Development Director** – audience alignment & legacy insight
- **Executive Director** – mission + fundraising alignment
- **Strategic Volunteer** – brand advisor & nonprofit lens

**Purpose:**

Finalize key components of the brand system:

- Logo
- Typography
- Color palette
- Messaging pillars

**Outcome:**

Aligned near-final brand system ready for validation check-ins.

---

## **💬 Light-Touch External Validation**

**Optional but Recommended (Confidence Boosting Step)**

**Who to include:**

- 2–3 focus group participants
- 1–2 younger/emerging supporters
- (Optional) 1 board member with strong radar for public tone

**How to test:**

- 15–20 min 1:1 conversations *or* short guided survey
- Focus questions:
    - Does this feel like Door County Land Trust?
    - Does it reflect our mission and values?
    - Is it emotionally resonant and trustworthy?
    - Is the design clear and legible?

**Important framing:**

> “This is a near-final system. We’re not seeking design edits — just a quick check for clarity, tone, and emotional fit.”
> 

---

## **📆 Suggested 4-Week Timeline**

| **Step** | **Owner** | **Timing** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Internal brand review (Core 5) | Comms Manager | **Week 1** |
| Revise system based on feedback | Comms Manager + Comm Coord | **Week 2** |
| Run 3–5 supporter check-ins | Comms Manager | **Week 2–3** |
| Finalize brand system | Comms Manager + Core Group | **Week 3** |
| Begin brand guideline creation + rollout planning | Team | **Week 4** |

## **🟡 Key Notes**

- Avoid over-democratization — this is **not** open-ended testing.
- Preserve clear ownership and editorial control.
- Use this step to *build confidence*, *strengthen alignment*, and *preempt last-minute friction* before rollout.
