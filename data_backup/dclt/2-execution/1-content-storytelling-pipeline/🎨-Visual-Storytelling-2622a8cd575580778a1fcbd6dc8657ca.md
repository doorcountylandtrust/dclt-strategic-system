# 🎨 Visual Storytelling

A visual companion to your story engine — supporting illustrations, photos, diagrams, and visual metaphors that align with the brand system.

**Purpose**: Strengthen emotional and informational clarity through visuals that enhance storytelling and deepen place connection.

## 🧠 Strategy Notes

- Use **photo + illustration pairings** to reinforce content type
- Align with brand tone: woodcut-inspired, natural textures, grounded realism
- Build re-usable assets for key modules (e.g. Preserve Explorer, Giving Tree)
- Consider **motion graphics** for campaign rollouts or story series
