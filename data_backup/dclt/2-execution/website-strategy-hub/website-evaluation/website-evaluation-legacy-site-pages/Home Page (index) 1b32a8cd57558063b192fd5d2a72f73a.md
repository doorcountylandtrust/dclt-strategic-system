Issues/Concerns: Cluttered Design:The homepage feels overcrowded with text, links, and multiple CTAs competing for attention. This can overwhelm visitors and reduce the effectiveness of individual elements.Inconsistent Visual Hierarchy:The lack of a clear visual structure makes it difficult to differentiate between primary and secondary content. For example, the “Take Action” section blends into the surrounding elements.Outdated Aesthetic:The design appears outdated and does not reflect modern web design trends. The typography, color scheme, and layout could benefit from a refresh to improve visual appeal.Mobile Responsiveness:The amount of content and layout suggests potential issues with readability and usability on smaller screens.Navigation Overload:The number of links in the navigation bar, footer, and content areas can be overwhelming. This could confuse users rather than guide them toward their goals.Generic Visuals:While the hero image is beautiful, other visuals like the sponsor logos and small thumbnails lack the emotional impact of high-quality photography or custom illustrations.
