# 📍 Preserve Experience (Explore Section)

This folder collects all information, IA, UX, and UI design decisions related to the `/explore` section of the DCLT website.

It covers:

- IA structure for Preserve discovery
- The Preserve Explorer map + list views
- Wireframes and content blocks for individual Preserve detail pages
- UX decisions related to filters, layouts, and discoverability

All pages here are tightly integrated and should be treated as a shared system.
