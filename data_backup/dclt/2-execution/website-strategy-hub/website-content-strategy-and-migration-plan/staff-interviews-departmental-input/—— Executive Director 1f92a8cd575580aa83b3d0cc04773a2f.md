# —— Executive Director

## **📝 Interview Summary – Executive Director**

### **Website Feedback**

- **What’s working / valued:**
    - Mission and values come through—comparable to the National Wildlife Federation.
    - The **preserves section** is likely the most-used content for visitors.
    - Photography is important—visually pleasing areas should be mirrored in the digital experience. Drone footage is great.
- **What’s not working:**
    - Navigation is confusing—“bunny trails” of outdated or piecemeal content.
    - No visible dates = can’t tell what’s current.
    - Disjointed transitions when leaving the site (e.g., GiveLively or event pages).
    - Feels cobbled together rather than intentional or user-centered.
- **Website goal / ideal visitor experience:**
    - Should feel **uplifting, empowering, magical**—evoking the emotional power of place.
    - Visitors should **understand what DCLT is**: a **community-supported nonprofit**, **not government or DNR**.
    - Should **invite and empower exploration**, building a sense of ownership.
    - Needs to convey that this is a **people-powered movement**, not just a collection of places.
- **Desired tools/resources:**
    - Better integration and flow between 3rd-party tools like GiveLively or event registration.
    - More dynamic and emotional storytelling with **photography of people enjoying nature**.
- **Audience perceptions:**
    - Confusion about what DCLT *is*—mistaken for a government agency.
    - Young people don’t see themselves in the membership model.
    - Membership = unclear; not seen as an identity or group, more like a transaction.

### **Communications Support Needs**

- Position DCLT more clearly as:
    - A **community-led conservation movement**, not a government entity.
    - A place where people **join a cause**, not just make a donation.
- Build emotional resonance:
    - Use visuals and messaging that “bottle the feeling” of staff warmth, volunteer spirit, awe of nature.
- Fix perception gap:
    - Younger audiences don’t resonate with the “membership” concept—needs modernization or rebranding.

## **🔍 Thematic Analysis**

| **Theme** | **Insight** |
| --- | --- |
| **Navigation & Usability** | Confusing, outdated structure is undermining the experience—needs major IA and content audit. |
| **Brand Identity Clarity** | Major confusion exists about whether DCLT is a government agency. Homepage must clarify who you are, quickly and confidently. |
| **Emotional Storytelling** | Website should evoke awe, belonging, and action. It’s not hitting that now—particularly missing *human* stories and feelings. |
| **Membership Relevance** | Traditional “membership” isn’t resonating, especially with younger people. Needs a rethink of language, structure, and benefits. |
| **Photography & Visuals** | Photography should tell the story of connection and magic—not just pretty places, but people in those places. |
| **Platform Fragmentation** | Off-site tools (GiveLively, registration, etc.) feel disconnected. Seamless transitions or integrations are needed. |

## **✅ Key Opportunities (Actionable Insights)**

| **Priority** | **Opportunity** | **Recommendation** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🔴 High | Redesign homepage for clarity and resonance | Immediately explain **who you are**, **why it matters**, and **how to join the mission**. Use visuals that show *people* and *place*. |
| 🔴 High | Simplify site architecture and remove outdated content | Audit pages, eliminate outdated “bunny trails,” and add **publish dates** or freshness indicators. |
| 🟡 Medium | Modernize the concept of membership | Test messaging like “Join the movement,” “Be part of the land’s future,” or “Support your wild places”—vs. transactional language. |
| 🟢 Low | Improve integration of external tools | Investigate smoother embed options or visual consistency between GiveLively/event systems and your main site. |
| 🟢 Low | Feature more people-based imagery and testimonials | Develop photo content showing board, volunteers, members in nature—reinforce the “welcoming group” vibe. |
