Participants expressed deep emotional and personal connections to Door County, emphasizing:

- Natural beauty and biodiversity
- Climate resilience (especially vs. Illinois and Cape Cod)
- Peaceful environment and outdoor recreation
- Strong cultural life and small-town feel

### **🔍 Observations and Critiques**

- **Land Acquisition Strategy:** One participant asked about perceived randomness of land acquisitions. Lucia responded by referencing a printed guide outlining conservation priorities.
- **Need for Education:** Several members urged the Land Trust to expand public education—connecting conservation to climate, water, air quality (e.g. wildfire haze), and dark skies.
- **Preservation vs. Access:** Participants praised the balance of natural preservation and public access via free, simple trailheads and hikes.
- **Legacy and Continuity:** Painting, hiking, and storytelling were mentioned as ways to preserve and pass down the landscape experience across generations.

## **💡 Participant Suggestions**

### **📢 Improve Communication & Education**

- Help connect dots between conservation and public health
- Expand community education beyond hikes (e.g., media, partnerships)

### **🛠️ Land Trust as a Connector**

- Position the Land Trust as a bridge between landowners, scientists, residents, and visitors
- Consider partnerships with other trail initiatives (e.g., Egg Harbor–Sister Bay trail)

### **🎨 Storytelling & Art**

- Leverage personal stories (e.g. Dave’s plein air paintings of all 15 preserves)
- Highlight how land trust protection ensures long-term continuity of landscapes

## **🎨 Focus Group 3 – Moodboard Analysis**

### **Group Overview**

**Participants:** Longtime Door County residents, artists, hikers, and conservation-minded retirees

**Facilitator:** Andrew Goldsworthy

**Staff Present:** Cinnamon Rossman, Lucia

**Date:** July 2024

**Focus:** Visual preferences, values alignment, and emotional resonance of potential brand directions

---

## **🎯 General Themes Across Moodboards**

- **Desire for authenticity and beauty:** Participants responded emotionally to real-life landscapes and recognizable Door County features (trails, trees, birds, shoreline).
- **Balance of realism and artistry:** A hybrid of illustration and photography was preferred by most—valued for its warmth, texture, and emotional storytelling.
- **Trust and clarity:** Fonts, maps, and layout choices heavily influenced the perception of trustworthiness and professionalism.
- **Mood resonance:** Participants consistently assessed each board by how it “felt” rather than specific design elements—using words like “curious,” “joyful,” “reflective,” “simple,” or “hard to connect with.”

## **💬 Moodboard-by-Moodboard Synthesis**

### **🟢 Moodboard A: “Symbolic and Abstract”**

**What Worked:**

- Strong use of icons and symbols sparked *some* interest (especially the stylized eagle and animals).
- Unique textures and layouts prompted curiosity—especially among participants with artistic backgrounds.

**What Didn’t:**

- Felt too abstract or metaphorical. Several participants struggled to “recognize Door County” in it.
- Was described as “not relatable” or “emotionally distant.”
- Lacked warmth or clarity. One participant said it felt “designed for someone else.”

**Interpretation:**

- **Useful as a sub-brand** or internal system styling (e.g., reports, donor-facing documents).
- Not strong enough for primary public-facing identity—needs more tangible and emotional cues.

### **🟡 Moodboard B: “Photographic and Approachable”**

**What Worked:**

- Universally liked for its real-life trail photos and “inviting” tone.
- Participants responded emotionally to the *path imagery*, describing it as peaceful, hopeful, or “a journey.”
- Felt “grounded in reality” and “welcoming.”

**Design Strengths:**

- Natural color palette (greens, browns, blues) resonated as authentically Door County.
- Considered the *most emotionally resonant*—a few called it “joyful” or “calming.”
- Photography was described as “helpful for people who don’t know what to expect.”

**Challenges:**

- Concerns about color accessibility: One participant flagged orange-on-green as hard to read.
- Risk of feeling generic if not carefully paired with localized typography and iconography.

**Interpretation:**

- **Best emotional core** for the brand. Build the primary storytelling layer from this tone.
- Pair with stronger type or icon system (as seen in Moodboard C) to avoid feeling “too soft” or lacking gravitas.

---

### **🔵 Moodboard C: “Illustrative, Clean, and Functional”**

**What Worked:**

- Fonts were widely praised—participants felt the serif typeface added “credibility,” “elegance,” and “warmth.”
- The illustrative trail map stood out as *especially engaging*. Multiple participants said it made them “want to explore.”
- Bird and forest illustrations were considered “memorable” and “representative of what’s worth protecting.”

**Design Strengths:**

- Clear systematization—participants could imagine this working across maps, kiosks, brochures, and online.
- Layout felt organized and “uncluttered.”
- Favored by those who appreciate a “classic” or “timeless” visual feel.

**Challenges:**

- Slight risk of coming off as “sterile” if not paired with photography or narrative elements.
- A few participants said it “felt institutional” or “a little flat.”

**Interpretation:**

- **Best system backbone.** Use for signage, templates, printed materials—build consistency around it.
- Combine with the color warmth and storytelling energy of Moodboard B for strongest resonance.

## **🧠 Cross-Moodboard Insights**

| **Theme** | **Insight** |
| --- | --- |
| **Photography vs. Illustration** | Participants want **both**—photos to ground the brand in real places, and illustrations to evoke curiosity and charm. |
| **Typography Matters** | Serif fonts were praised in Moodboard C as **trustworthy** and warm. Avoid “modern sans” that feel sterile or overly digital. |
| **Color Accessibility** | Use nature-inspired tones, but be cautious with saturated oranges and fine detail on green backgrounds. |
| **Maps = Emotion** | Trail maps are not just functional—they’re a source of pride and identity. Participants loved seeing them represented artistically. |
| **Birds & Trees** | Specific love for birds (especially species that appear locally) and recognizable woodland visuals. |
| **Simplicity & Calm** | Clarity and breathing room were repeatedly valued. Avoid overwhelming designs or metaphor-heavy imagery. |

## **🧩 Strategic Design Direction**

### **Recommendation: Hybrid System**

| **Layer** | **Source** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Emotional/Story Layer** | Moodboard B | Photography-driven storytelling, social media, banners, campaigns |
| **System/Infrastructure Layer** | Moodboard C | Kiosks, brochures, internal docs, trail maps |
| **Symbolic/Donor Layer** | Elements from A | Sub-brand for legacy materials, challenge gifts, campaign logos |
