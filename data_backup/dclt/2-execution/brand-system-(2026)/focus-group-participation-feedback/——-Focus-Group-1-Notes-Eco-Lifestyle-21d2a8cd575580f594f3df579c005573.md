- Impact: More concentrated housing developments changing landscape character
- Connection to Land Trust mission: Protecting open space becomes more critical

**Water Quality Issues (Miriam's detailed analysis):**

- Solution requirement: *"It's gonna require an alignment for everybody who's up here"*

**Development Pressure (Rex's generational perspective):**

- Historical context: *"There used to be a lot of land that was undeveloped... most agriculture land at least had a woods like 20 to 40, 60, 80 acres of woods connected to it"*
- Current reality: *"You watch those get cut off and sold and sold again, and old farmhouses get ripped down"*
- Emotional impact: *"The Door County that I grew up seeing... is gone. It's changed a lot"*

### 2. Land Trust Role Definition - Consensus Building

**Primary Role - Protector:**

- **Miriam's framework:** *"You have a finite amount of resources. Where are you allocating them? Are you focusing on education? Are you focusing on Land Restoration... it seems like Land Trust has historically been let's just get as many acres protected as humanly possible. And I guess I'm inclined to kind of agree with that."*

**Collaboration Strategy:**

- **Tawnie on "cross pollination":** Organizations working together, pooling resources
- **Examples mentioned:** Wild Ones, Master Gardeners, The Ridges, Door County Seed Library

- **Lottery system:** *"X amount of tags for sale for a certain dollar amount"*
- **Designated hunting areas:** *"Carve out like, hey, here are some good places to hunt... this is a safe place where you can shoot"*
- **Revenue potential:** *"If you wanna raise more money to protect more land, I think there's a huge opportunity there"*

### **1. 🧭 Moodboard Analysis: Layered Insights**

### **Moodboard A:**

### **“Earthy, Symbolic, Legacy-Focused”**

**What Worked:**

- Strong symbolic visuals (wolf, heron, river, pine) appealed to participants’ love for nature and local identity.
- The handmade illustration style resonated, especially among those with an arts or photography background.
- The rich greens and ochres signaled seriousness and depth.

**What Didn’t:**

- Perceived by Rex as “dark and dreary,” evoking a rainy day, stay-inside mood. Lacked warmth or approachability.
- Some icons felt “heavy” or “dated” to others, possibly because of the darker palette and denser visual weight.

**Interpretation:**

- **Emotional weight is present but not inviting.** It speaks to the mission’s seriousness, but not necessarily to public participation or joy.
- Could evolve into a **“heritage sub-brand”** or donor-level identity, but would need more lightness and entry points to be the primary brand.

---

### **Moodboard B:**

### **“Approachable, Nature-as-Experience”**

**What Worked:**

- Universally liked. Color palette seen as bright, inviting, and “cheerful without being childish.”
- “Choose your own adventure” layout was memorable—participants liked having clear pathways (trails, mission, planning).
- Elements like flowers and soft topography gave it an inclusive, outdoorsy charm.

**What Didn’t:**

- Some saw it as bordering on too soft or stylized—lacking the gravity of conservation work.
- Could risk becoming trendy or dated faster due to more “illustrative whimsy.”

**Interpretation:**

- This board functions as your **emotional core.** It was the strongest at sparking connection and should anchor your brand’s “public face.”
- Pair with some of A’s symbolism and C’s clarity to strengthen depth and longevity.

---

### **Moodboard C:**

### **“Modern, Masculine, Institutional”**

**What Worked:**

- Some praised the minimalism and found the eagle symbol strong and iconic—“more masculine,” “confident,” “professional.”
- Layout and type feel scalable—good for systematizing signage, forms, publications.

**What Didn’t:**

- Least emotionally resonant. Described as “formal,” “corporate,” or “default” by some.
- Lacked visual storytelling or narrative cues—it doesn’t *invite* engagement; it *announces.*

**Interpretation:**

- This functions well as a **design system backbone**, but cannot carry the brand alone.
- Consider using this style selectively for **official documents, reports, or wayfinding**, while using B for campaigns and outreach.

---

### **2. 🧠 Strategic Recommendations**

### **A. Build a Hybrid System**

Create a brand system that **layers tone**, not flattens it. Think in **tiers**:

- **Tier 1 (Public Experience):** Based on Moodboard B, leads with approachability and emotional resonance.
- **Tier 2 (Institutional/Legacy):** Moodboard A elements refined—used for donor-facing, legacy giving, or landowner communications.
- **Tier 3 (System & Infrastructure):** Moodboard C as foundation for signage, publications, backend tools, with consistent layout rules.

### **B. Typography Direction**

- Keep **Mackinac + Inter** pairing from B—widely praised and versatile.
- Consider how A’s serif might pair as a display option for legacy/heritage-focused content (e.g., quotes, memorials, landowner tributes).

### **C. Logo Iteration Ideas**

- Many liked the **illustrative bird/animal elements** in A. Explore **integrating fauna into a flexible badge**, perhaps using silhouettes inspired by local species.
- Bring B’s warmth into the **logo color palette**, even if the mark itself leans C-style minimal.

### **D. Visual Storytelling**

- Participants want more **human presence**: trails, families, real Door County scenes.
- Reintroduce **photographic components** into digital mockups—e.g., hero image of a preserve with people using the land.

### **E. Cross-Platform Flexibility**

- Design for **scalable complexity**: icons and layouts that compress well into social media, signage, and merch.
- A’s icon grid and C’s layout hierarchy can inform **micro content strategy**: wayfinding, quick facts, action prompts.
