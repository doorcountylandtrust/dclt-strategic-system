# Key Insights → Future Brand Strategy Steps

*Connecting research findings to concrete brand evolution actions.*

---

### **🎯 Purpose**

Document and align the most important audience, brand, and engagement insights that emerged from the 2024–2025 rebrand research — and map them directly to future decisions, deliverables, and checkpoints in the brand refresh process.

---

### **🔍 Key Insights**

### **1. Both legacy and new audiences care deeply about land protection**

> Despite generational and stylistic differences, everyone agrees land protection is the Land Trust’s core role.
> 

**→ Strategy Step:**

Keep protection as the central brand pillar. Anchor messaging in protection-first language across homepage, campaigns, and appeals.

---

### **2. Younger audiences crave transparency, video, and interaction**

> Group 1 wants process visibility, user-generated content, and storytelling that makes them feel like participants.
> 

**→ Strategy Step:**

Develop storytelling video plan and supporter overlay system (linked: [📖 Storytelling CRM Overlay System]). Introduce explainer content and participatory formats in campaigns.

---

### **3. Older supporters feel emotionally distanced from the newer brand tone**

> Long-term volunteers and donors miss the warmth and personal connection they once felt.
> 

**→ Strategy Step:**

Design Legacy Circle touchpoints and nostalgic print materials. Integrate soft touches in brand tone and direct mail. (Linked: [Legacy Conservationist Engagement Plan])

---

### **4. Both groups prefer clean, authentic, local imagery — not stock or abstract design**

> Mood board feedback shows a strong aversion to dark/heavy visuals and non-Door-County scenes.
> 

**→ Strategy Step:**

Prioritize real photography, local illustration, and maps. Kill all mountain/stock clichés. (Linked: [🖼️ Visual Identity Guidelines])

---

### **5. Event timing and volunteer opportunities are a barrier for working professionals**

> Mid-day weekday events limit inclusion for younger/working supporters.
> 

**→ Strategy Step:**

Restructure volunteer program with evening/weekend slots and larger quarterly events. Use new brand system to visually highlight opportunities. (Linked: [Volunteer Strategy Refresh])

---

### **6. Print still matters — especially to legacy donors**

> Strong enthusiasm for calendars, newsletters, and direct mail among older supporters.
> 

**→ Strategy Step:**

Ensure print-ready brand templates exist in the new system. Design for dual-channel flexibility (print + digital). (Linked: [Design Template Library])

---

### **7. The current logo is seen as outdated and confusing by both groups**

> “Too sanitized,” “boring,” and “teepee trees” all surfaced.
> 

**→ Strategy Step:**

Advance logo refinement that keeps the arch/window metaphor but adds clearer Door County references. User-test options across demographics. (Linked: [Finalize Logo & System])
