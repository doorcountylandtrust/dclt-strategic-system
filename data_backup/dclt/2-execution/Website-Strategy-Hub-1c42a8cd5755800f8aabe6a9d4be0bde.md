# Website Strategy Hub

**PURPOSE**: This hub is the central planning space for our website redesign. It consolidates strategic, technical, and messaging elements to ensure a coherent, audience-centered rebuild.

> 📘 This hub contains everything related to the DCLT website redesign, including evaluations, technical builds, content strategy, and migration planning.

## **Why a Website Still Matters Deeply (and Possibly More Than Ever)**

### 1. **Credibility + Trust Anchor**

- For new donors, partners, volunteers, or media, your website is the first impression and primary *validation* point.
- If it looks outdated or lacks clarity, trust and perceived professionalism suffer—especially in a crowded nonprofit space.

### 2. **Owned Channel**

- It’s the one digital asset you *own*. Social platforms and email providers can throttle reach or change algorithms—but your website is under your control.
- Essential for long-term resilience and mission clarity.

### 3. **Conversion Engine**

- Donation forms, email signups, event registrations, volunteering interest—all critical actions typically happen (or should happen) on your site.
- Without a clear user journey and CTAs, you're losing out on engaged users.

### 4. **Central Hub for Integrated Comms**

- All campaigns (email, print, social, paid ads, PR) should lead back to it.
- A strong content strategy on your site can power everything else—think landing pages, resource libraries, campaign archives.

### 5. **SEO and Discoverability**

- For many, Google is the front door. Your website’s content determines how visible and credible you are in organic search, especially for cause-specific terms, events, and local engagement.

## **When a Website Fails (and Why It Gets Undervalued)**

### 1. **It’s Static, Outdated, or Doesn’t Reflect the Brand**

- Nonprofits often neglect regular updates or fail to align the website with current storytelling, impact, or visual identity.

### 2. **No Analytics = No Insight**

- If you’re not using tools like GA4 or Hotjar, you can’t measure engagement or improve UX. That makes the site feel like a black hole, which leads people to undervalue it.

### 3. **Poor Mobile UX**

- Many nonprofits still haven’t optimized for mobile—critical, as up to 60% of traffic is now mobile-first, especially from email or social.

### 📈 How Forward-Thinking Nonprofits Are Using Their Websites Today

- **Persona-Based Navigation:** Different landing zones or resource trails for donors, landowners, members, press, etc.
- **Impact Dashboards:** Living, visual storytelling of progress—not just a blog archive.
- **Content Hubs:** Evergreen and campaign-based storytelling, feeding social/email.
- **Digital Stewardship:** Welcome series, donation receipts, and renewal journeys supported by dynamic content tied to donor history.
