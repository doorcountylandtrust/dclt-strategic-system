## 🌄 Strategic Communications Goals (2025–2029)

Our communications strategy will:

- **Amplify Land Protection & Stewardship** – Educate the public about conservation efforts, acquisitions, and restoration projects.
- **Increase Community Engagement & Support** – Strengthen outreach to new demographics, volunteers, and donors.
- **Enhance Fundraising & Legacy Giving Communications** – Support major campaigns with compelling storytelling.
- **Strengthen Partnerships & Thought Leadership** – Position DCLT as a key conservation advocate.

📌 *Strategic Note*: Develop a clear editorial calendar and workflow pipeline to support these pillars.
