[🔗 [View full research brief →] **Modern Membership Strategy & Research Brief**](%F0%9F%93%81%20Membership%20Strategy%20Hub%2023f2a8cd575580049256c982bb3ada0c/%E2%80%94%20Modern%20Membership%20Strategy%20&%20Research%20Brief%202072a8cd575580818fbdf8e62c7fb49f.md)

### *Purpose:* Core research synthesis on post-membership engagement models.

### 🔍 Executive Summary

This research reimagines how DCLT can structure supporter engagement in a post-membership era. Integrating behavioral science, psychographics, nonprofit case studies, and UX design principles, this report identifies models that replace outdated "join" concepts with scalable, identity-driven pathways to belonging, giving, and action.

### 📅 Cultural & Generational Attitudes Toward Membership

| Generation | Belonging Style | What Builds Trust | What Repels |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gen Z (<27) | Movement-based, participatory | Authenticity, peer action, climate impact | Formality, exclusivity, paper newsletters |
| Millennials (28–44) | Identity-driven, cause-aligned | Transparency, emotional storytelling, digital access | Complexity, unclear CTAs |
| Gen X (45–60) | Pragmatic, family-legacy oriented | Stewardship, flexibility, smart use of resources | Bureaucracy, wasteful swag |
| Boomers (61+) | Institutional loyalty, values-driven | Longevity, legacy, land permanence | Rapid change, disregard for tradition |

### 🤬 Behavioral Triggers for Engagement

- **Social Proof:** Highlight peer actions (maps, stories)
- **Storytelling:** Lead with emotional and personal impact
- **Identity Cues:** Use tiered language and supporter archetypes
- **Urgency + Ease:** Marry emotion with low-friction UX

### UX Implications:

- Repeated, visible CTAs
- Micro-commitments: Pledges before donations
- Interest-based segmentation options

### 🏫 Annotated Case Studies:

- **Jackson Hole Land Trust**: Family legacy tiers + community visual impact
- **REI Co-op**: Cultural alignment, not dues
- **Save the Redwoods League**: Narrative tiers and monthly model
- **Audubon**: UX-driven, data-segmented flows

### 👥 Supporter Archetypes

| Persona | Description | Messaging Hook |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Legacy Steward | Older donor, legacy-focused | "Leave a gift that lasts generations" |
| Quiet Neighbor | Values nature, not fanfare | "Keep the wild, wild" |
| Climate Mobilizer | Youthful, urgency-focused | "Act on climate. Protect biodiversity." |
| Nature-Loving Family | Kids + trails | "Hike, learn, give back together" |
| Landowner Ally | CE-contemplative | "Your land, your legacy" |

### 🔧 UX Patterns & Digital Infrastructure

**Replace 'Membership' with:**

- Supporter Tiers
- Land Allies Network
- Seasonal Stewardship
- Movement Builders

**Funnel Structure:**

1. Awareness Page
2. Story Layer (preserves, staff, community)
3. Action Hub (give, volunteer, pledge)
4. Recurring Ask (sustainers)

### 🌍 Messaging + CRM Integration

**Tier Names:** Trailblazer, Protector, Legacy Builder, Seasonal Steward, Evergreen Circle

**CRM Tags:**

- Interests: hiking, wildlife, landowner
- First-touch source: social, site, event
- Communication style: action-taker, story-lover, donor

### 📊 Recommendations for DCLT

1. Retire "Join / Renew" in favor of "Support / Belong / Act"
2. Segment supporter pages and email journeys
3. Personalize stories by archetype
4. Promote recurring at low lift ($5/mo)
5. Test naming conventions
6. Wireframe UX for journeys, not org structure

### 📝 Strategic Summary: Evolving Membership into a Movement

### 🧠 The Gist:

You're not asking people to "become members." You're inviting them to belong to a movement.

[**🔗[Full manifesto-style summary →] Strategic Summary: Evolving Membership into a Movement**](%F0%9F%93%81%20Membership%20Strategy%20Hub%2023f2a8cd575580049256c982bb3ada0c/%E2%80%94%20Modern%20Membership%20Strategy%20&%20Research%20Brief%202072a8cd575580818fbdf8e62c7fb49f/%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%20Strategic%20Summary%20Evolving%20Membership%20into%20a%20Mo%2020d2a8cd575580159e96fb5b4a583846.md)

### 🔄 Old vs. New Paradigm:

| Old Model | New Model |
| --- | --- |
| Fixed tiers, annual dues | Identity-driven, flexible engagement |
| Benefits-focused | Values + impact focused |
| "Join / Renew" | "Act / Belong / Sustain" |
| One-size-fits-all | Psychographic segmentation |
| Money = support | Movement = meaning (money is one piece) |

### 💡 Five Strategic Pillars:

1. **Transformation, Not Transaction** – Let people join the story
2. **Segment by Motivation** – Show them their place in the movement
3. **Layered Funnels** – Entry points from quiz to pledge to legacy giving
4. **Shared Language** – Movement-based tier names and supporter-centric language
5. **Movement Feeling** – Social proof, stories, rituals, shareables

### ✅ Immediate Action Areas:

- Rebuild supporter landing pages
- Update CTA language
- Create welcome journeys
- Align CRM tagging to interests
- Seasonal campaigns + urgency framing
