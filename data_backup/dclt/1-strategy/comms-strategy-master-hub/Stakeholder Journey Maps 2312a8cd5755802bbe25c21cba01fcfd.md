## 🧩 Journey Map Framework

| Stage | Emotion | Questions They're Asking | What They Need From Us |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Unaware** | Disconnected, neutral | “What’s changing?” | Gentle visibility, teaser content |
| **2. Alerted** | Curious, skeptical | “Why are you doing this?” | Purpose-first framing, clarity |
| **3. Processing** | Cautious, overwhelmed | “Is this still for me?” | Reassurance, continuity messaging |
| **4. Re-engaging** | Hopeful, intrigued | “What’s new for me here?” | Targeted invites, practical updates |
| **5. Advocating** | Confident, proud | “How can I help share this?” | Tools, language, recognitions |
