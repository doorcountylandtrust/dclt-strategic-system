# Audience Segmentation and Stakeholder Messaging Strategy for DC Land Trust

This research report provides best practices, frameworks, and case studies to guide audience segmentation and stakeholder messaging strategies for land trusts and conservation nonprofits. It supports persona development, message alignment, and outreach planning for our 5-Year Communications Strategy.

Land trusts and conservation nonprofits rely on effective communication to build broad support for their mission. As the Land Trust Alliance notes, strategic goals ultimately come down to **people**: “We need to connect with more people. That puts communications at the core of our work… At a land trust, connecting with people is everyone’s job.”

[landtrustalliance.org](https://landtrustalliance.org/resources/learn/topics/communications#:~:text=There%20is%20increasing%20pressure%20to,the%20core%20of%20our%20work)

To achieve this, organizations must segment their audiences and tailor messaging and engagement strategies to each group. This report provides a deep-dive into audience segmentation and stakeholder messaging. It covers common audience segments, messaging differences with examples, channels and engagement tactics for each segment, useful frameworks and tools, and metrics to evaluate success. The goal is to inform a 5-year communications strategy that leverages best practices in conservation communications.

## Why Segment Audiences in Conservation Communications

In a “by-the-book” communications plan, you **define key audiences**, identify the channels they prefer, tailor messages for each, and continuously measure results.
Few land trusts historically have done this rigorously – many default to treating “everyone the same” with generic messaging.
Source: **Communicating with “People Who Give Money”** [developmentforconservation.com](https://developmentforconservation.com/2022/communicating-with-people-who-give-money/#:~:text=Very%20few%20land%20trusts%20are,even%20coming%20close%20to%20that)

However, conservation organizations are increasingly recognizing that a one-size-fits-all approach falls short. Audience segmentation allows land trusts to broaden their appeal beyond the usual supporters and deepen engagement by speaking to what each group cares about.

For example, one urban land trust realized its supporter base was a “small and homogenous” slice of the community and set out to **diversify its audience** through segmented messaging.
By identifying current vs. desired audiences, they crafted strategies for each: current supporters (older donors, landowners) got tailored engagement like personal stories and events, while new target audiences (younger adults, people of color, local policy champions) were reached with climate-resilience messaging and social media content.
Source: **Crafting an organizational audience profile** [landtrustalliance.org](https://landtrustalliance.org/resources/learn/explore/communicating-about-climate-change/crafting-an-organizational-audience-profile?queryID=c7f8b02f86f212700d932ff823a8f574#:~:text=support%20organizations%20tackling%20the%20climate,crisis)

This kind of segmentation – based on demographics, values, and relationship to the land – is crucial for land trusts to **build “deep and wide” support for conservation**.

**Common ways land trusts segment audiences include:** by stakeholder role (e.g. landowner vs. donor), by demographics (age, generation, cultural group), by engagement level (new prospect vs. longtime supporter), by interest area (birders, hikers, hunters, etc.), and by geography (local community vs. broader region). The segmentation should be informed by the organization’s goals (e.g. attracting younger supporters, engaging more landowners in easements, mobilizing volunteers) and grounded in research about what motivates each group.

## Key Stakeholder Segments for Land Trusts

Land trusts typically interact with several **stakeholder groups**, each with distinct motivations and needs. Below are the most common audience segments and their general characteristics:

- **Landowners:** These are private landowners (from farmers to forest owners to family estates) who either already have protected land (e.g. via conservation easements) or are potential conservation partners. They may range from avid conservationists to those unfamiliar or even skeptical of land protection. Often, landowners are long-time community members with deep personal attachment to their land, and many are older adults. Engaging landowners is critical, as their buy-in can lead to land preservation projects. (In the U.S., individuals and families own a huge portion of natural land, so “persuading these individuals and families to be good stewards…is essential”.) However, this group is not monolithic – for example, research on woodland owners identifies segments from **“Woodland Retreat” owners** (who own land for its beauty and wildlife value) to **“Uninvolved” owners** (who assign low importance to the woods and might be willing to sell). Thus, even within landowners, sub-segmentation by attitude is useful.

- **Donors and Members:** Financial supporters are the lifeblood of nonprofit conservation. “People Who Give Money,” as one land trust consultant dubs them, tend to have some common traits: typically age 50–80, often well-educated, predominately female (in many regions), and passionate about the cause. Many are retirees or affluent individuals who love nature and want to give back. They might be local community members or supporters from afar who value the land trust’s work. Donors often overlap with **members** in organizations that have membership programs; they could range from small-dollar annual members to major donors and foundation funders. This group is usually already bought into the conservation mission, but needs to feel appreciated and see the impact of their gifts.

    - **What We Know About Our Donors and Members (2015 Survey)**
    **Based on the 2015 member survey:**
    • 55% of members are 65+ and 56.1% are retired
    • 84% give financially, ~20% volunteer
    • Top interests include hiking, birding, and stewardship
    • Members prioritize land protection, water quality, and habitat health
    • DCLT is a top-tier charity for most respondents
    
    These traits align with the “People Who Give Money” segment and could shape messaging, tone, and content strategy.

- **Volunteers:** Volunteers give time and talent – from stewarding preserves (trail maintenance, invasive species removal, monitoring easements) to helping with events and outreach. They are often local residents and may also be donors (indeed, many volunteers donate, and vice versa). Volunteers can include **outdoor enthusiasts** (hikers, birders, hunters, anglers) who enjoy hands-on work, students or young people seeking experience, or retirees looking to stay active and contribute. A notable segment many land trusts mention are “newly retired individuals (often women) who have a latent interest in making a difference for the Earth through volunteering”. Volunteers seek a sense of community, fulfillment, and visible results from their efforts.

- **Partners and Allies:** This broad segment includes other organizations, agencies, and community leaders that collaborate or influence the land trust’s work. Examples: local government officials and town boards, the parks department, state DNR or conservation agencies, the Land Trust Alliance and state associations (e.g. Gathering Waters in Wisconsin), other nonprofits (like local nature centers or watershed groups), indigenous communities, and even local businesses (e.g. an outdoor recreation company sponsoring an event). Partners usually already support conservation in principle but need clear communication to align efforts. Within this segment, **policymakers** (legislators, county officials) are key sub-audience – they may not be directly involved in projects but can champion policies or funding that benefit conservation.
- **General Public (Community):** The broader community in the land trust’s region, including residents who may not yet be directly involved. This audience ranges widely – from nature lovers who visit preserves, to taxpayers who vote on funding measures, to local youth and families who might attend educational programs. It also includes specific interest groups like recreational users (hikers, bikers, birdwatchers), local media audiences, and **diverse demographic groups** the land trust may wish to reach more effectively (e.g. younger people, communities of color, rural vs. urban audiences). Many land trusts have recognized they need to engage beyond their traditional base to remain relevant. For instance, some are aiming to involve more young adults and racially diverse community members in conservation, evolving from a mostly older white supporter base.
Source: **Crafting an organizational audience profile** [landtrustalliance.org](https://landtrustalliance.org/resources/learn/explore/communicating-about-climate-change/crafting-an-organizational-audience-profile?queryID=c7f8b02f86f212700d932ff823a8f574#:~:text=support%20organizations%20tackling%20the%20climate,crisis)

Each of these segments has different relationships to the land trust. By **creating audience profiles or personas** for each, the organization can clarify who they’re talking to. A persona template typically includes a fictional name and bio (e.g. *“Trailblazer Tina – a 35-year-old outdoor enthusiast and new volunteer”* or *“Conservation Charlie – a 70-year-old long-time donor who owns land in the county”*), plus that persona’s goals, values, preferred channels, and the message that will resonate with them. For example, a land trust might have a persona for a “Family Landowner” vs. a “Millennial Nature Lover,” ensuring each gets communications that feel personally relevant.

*Local Context:* In Door County, Wisconsin, a place known for its natural beauty and strong conservation ethic, these segments are very much in play. **Door County Land Trust**, for instance, is supported by over *4,200 households* who “love Door County”

– indicating a substantial community of donors and members. Many are likely seasonal residents or retirees drawn to the peninsula’s landscapes. At the same time, Door County Land Trust works closely with landowner families to protect farms, forests, and shorelines, and relies on volunteers for stewardship. A communications strategy here must consider year-round locals *and* seasonal tourists, long-time supporters *and* new audiences (like younger families settling in the area), and stakeholders ranging from town boards to tourism bureaus. Keeping messaging consistent with local values (such as Aldo Leopold’s **“land ethic”** legacy in Wisconsin) can be a unifying theme across segments.

**Equity Lens:** To support equitable and inclusive outreach, we’re incorporating the **Whole Communities Framework** as a lens for understanding which stakeholders we’re currently reaching—and which may be underserved.

This quadrant model helps us examine each audience segment not only by *what they value* (land, people, wellness, justice), but also by *where they sit in systems of privilege*. It reveals who we tend to focus on (e.g., legacy donors and retirees) and prompts us to consider how to better engage groups like youth in environmental justice spaces, frontline communities, or culturally diverse local groups.

## Tailoring Messages and Channels for Each Audience Segment

Different stakeholder groups require **different messaging approaches**. The core mission and values stay consistent, but the framing, tone, and calls-to-action should be adjusted to align with what each audience cares about. Below we examine each major segment – **what messages resonate**, provide examples of conservation-related messaging, and identify the **best communication channels and engagement strategies** to reach them effectively.

### Landowners: Emphasize Partnership and Legacy

**Messaging:** For landowners, especially those who might donate a conservation easement or adopt better land practices, the message should focus on **trust, mutual benefit, and legacy**. Land trusts often position themselves as *partners* helping the landowner achieve their personal goals for their property. Effective messages highlight how conserving their land will: protect their *family legacy* (ensuring the land stays undeveloped for future generations), uphold their *values* (love of the land, wildlife, or a rural way of life), and even provide practical benefits (estate planning help, potential tax incentives, or peace of mind). It’s important to **avoid jargon or pressure** – instead of “restricting development rights,” communications might speak of “voluntarily protecting the character of your land forever.” Storytelling is powerful: for example, sharing a success story of a local farmer who worked with the land trust to preserve their fields for posterity can inspire others. Language that respects property rights and highlights the *landowner’s role as a steward* works well (“You’ve cared for this land for decades; we can help you ensure it remains wild and thriving long into the future”). In more skeptical communities, emphasizing common ground (such as preserving clean water, or keeping the land in the family) can bridge ideological divides.

**Channels & Engagement:** Landowners are best reached through **personal, relationship-based channels**. Often the first contact is a *one-on-one meeting* or phone call rather than mass media. As the Land Trust Alliance notes, the initial meeting sets the tone: providing clear information and establishing personal rapport is “vitally important” to success

[landtrustalliance.org](https://landtrustalliance.org/resources/learn/explore/meeting-with-landowners#:~:text=The%20first%20contact%20a%20landowner,for%20a%20successful%20landowner%20meeting)

. Strategies include:

- **Site visits:** Visiting the landowner’s property with them, walking the land and listening to their stories. This builds trust and lets the landowner feel heard.
- **Print materials:** Well-designed landowner guides or brochures (perhaps including testimonials from other landowners) that they can review at their own pace. Older landowners especially appreciate print.
- **Workshops/Meetings:** Hosting informational workshops on topics like estate planning, invasive species management, or habitat restoration – useful content that attracts landowners and subtly introduces the idea of conservation easements or programs.
- **Neighbor Networks:** Word-of-mouth is key. Many land trusts foster “landowner networks” or peer ambassadors – e.g. a respected farmer who has conserved land can speak to fellow farmers about his positive experience.
- **Follow-up and Stewardship:** Even after an easement is completed, continued communication (annual monitoring visits, newsletters for easement landowners) keeps the relationship strong. This segment values *personal contact* over impersonal media, so staff time invested in coffee chats or phone check-ins is worthwhile.

For broad communications, **local media** can help – human-interest stories in local newspapers about families who protected their land can pique interest. But ultimately, engaging landowners often happens off the public stage, through **trusted messengers** (staff, volunteers, or other landowners) and careful, personalized outreach.

### Donors (Members): Show Impact, Appreciation, and Need

**Messaging:** Donors need to **feel the impact** of their support and be emotionally rewarded for giving. Messages to this group should consistently communicate three things: *gratitude* (“Thank you for making our work possible”), *impact* (“Your gift protected 100 acres of critical habitat – see the wildlife now thriving there”), and *continued need* (“There is more to do and with your ongoing help we can achieve it”)

[developmentforconservation.com](https://developmentforconservation.com/2022/communicating-with-people-who-give-money/#:~:text=And%20what%20about%20the%20messaging%3F)

. A donor communication expert notes that donors “need to hear that their gift matters,” that they “invested wisely,” and that their help is still needed

[developmentforconservation.com](https://developmentforconservation.com/2022/communicating-with-people-who-give-money/#:~:text=And%20what%20about%20the%20messaging%3F)

. Storytelling is essential: instead of generic stats, share a compelling story of how a donor’s contribution saved a beloved community forest or provided outdoor education for kids.

**Emotional appeal**

paired with concrete results strikes the right balance

[fiftyandfifty.org](https://fiftyandfifty.org/are-your-donor-communication-strategies-effective/#:~:text=Create%20a%20communication%20plan)

. For example, a message might be:

*“Thanks to your generosity, the endangered Orchid Valley is now a protected sanctuary – an investment that will benefit wildlife and our children for generations. We’re proud to steward your donation wisely, and we invite you to visit the preserve you helped create. With development pressures rising, your continued support is vital to save more places like this.”*

Such messaging reinforces the donor’s pride and commitment.

Donors also appreciate **recognition** (e.g. listing names in annual reports or signage) and transparency (updates on how funds are used). For major donors, more personalized messages (handwritten thank-you notes, phone calls from board members, invitations to special insider events) are important. Another consideration is aligning messaging with donor interests: if some donors gave specifically to a “Protect the Wetlands” campaign, segment communications so they receive updates on that project.

**Channels & Engagement:** Donor communications should be **multi-channel**, combining digital and traditional methods, but remember that many older donors still **love print**. In fact, land trust fundraising experts observe that while donors may consume digital media, they “retain and be motivated by what they read in print” – hence “we need to communicate using paper also” (e.g. mailed newsletters) for maximum effectiveness

[developmentforconservation.com](https://developmentforconservation.com/2022/communicating-with-people-who-give-money/#:~:text=People%20Who%20Give%20Money%20absorb,good%20decisions%20with%20their%20money)

. Key channels include:

- **Newsletters (Print & Email):** A quarterly print newsletter remains a staple for many land trusts to tell stories of impact. Email updates can supplement with more frequency (monthly e-news, project announcements), but print often leaves a lasting impression. Keep newsletters concise, photo-rich, and focused on achievements the donor contributed to. (Research suggests a 4-page newsletter four times a year is more effective than a massive annual report.)
    
    [developmentforconservation.com](https://developmentforconservation.com/2022/communicating-with-people-who-give-money/#:~:text=People%20Who%20Give%20Money%20absorb,good%20decisions%20with%20their%20money)
    
    [developmentforconservation.com](https://developmentforconservation.com/2022/communicating-with-people-who-give-money/#:~:text=To%20communicate%20effectively%20with%20People,pager%20delivered%20only%20twice)
    
- **Thank-You Letters & Reports:** Prompt, heartfelt thank-you letters for each donation, and annual impact reports. Personalized notes for major gifts.
- **Events:** Donor appreciation events, such as guided hikes on preserves, annual galas or donor brunches, offer in-person connection. These let donors see the land and meet the people their dollars support.
- **Direct Mail Appeals:** Segmented appeal letters (e.g. one version to long-time donors vs. another to lapsed donors) can increase response by speaking more directly to each group’s history and interests.
- **Phone Calls & Personal Outreach:** Especially for major donors or older supporters, a personal call or visit to thank them or ask for input can deepen loyalty.
- **Online & Social Media:** While older donors may not all be on Instagram, many do use email and Facebook. Sharing donor impact stories on social media and tagging or acknowledging donors (with permission) can reinforce community. Crowdfunding campaigns or peer-to-peer fundraising (where donors encourage friends to give) can target younger donor segments.

The engagement strategy for donors often follows an **engagement ladder** from first-time giver to repeat giver to advocate. For instance, a new donor might get a welcome series (emails introducing the mission and inviting them to an event), then be asked to renew their support next year, and over time perhaps become a monthly sustainer or even leave a legacy gift. Treating donors as partners in the mission, not just ATM machines, is key – invite their feedback, involve them in volunteer days if they’re interested, and report back frequently on the impact of their generosity.

### Volunteers: Foster Community and Highlight Contribution

**Messaging:** Volunteers respond to messaging that makes them feel **valued, connected, and empowered**. They are giving their time for free, so recognizing that and tying volunteer work to the mission’s success is critical. Messages to volunteers should emphasize *the impact of their work* (“Thanks to volunteer efforts, 5 miles of trail are now accessible” or “Your dedication helped restore prairie habitat for pollinators”) and *appreciation* (“We couldn’t do this without our amazing volunteers”). It’s also effective to build a sense of **community and pride** – referring to volunteers as part of the “Land Trust family” or “team of conservation heroes.” For example, a volunteer newsletter might open with *“Dear Conservation Volunteers, thanks to you, our preserves are thriving! Here’s an update on what we achieved together this season…”*. Featuring volunteer stories (profiles of individual volunteers and why they get involved) can inspire others and make existing volunteers feel seen.

The tone for volunteers is often enthusiastic and inclusive. Use calls-to-action that invite them to deepen engagement: “Join us for Volunteer Appreciation Day” or “Sign up for our advanced trail steward training to expand your skills.” Also, if the goal is to convert some volunteers into donors (a common strategy), messaging can gently bridge that—e.g., noting how volunteer contributions and donor support together make projects possible, or suggesting “Volunteer-Only” fundraising challenges (some volunteers are very willing to donate as well, once they’re deeply involved).

**Channels & Engagement:** Volunteers often prefer **direct, conversational channels** and platforms that facilitate coordination. Effective channels include:

- **Email Lists or Volunteer Management Platforms:** Regular volunteer e-blasts with upcoming opportunities, updates, and thank-yous. Using a volunteer management tool (or even a Facebook Group or Slack) can help coordinate schedules and allow interaction.
- **Social Media Groups:** Many land trusts create private Facebook Groups or use social media to rally volunteers (e.g. posting photos from work days and tagging volunteers). This builds camaraderie and recognition publicly.
- **Texts or Phone Trees:** For active volunteers, text messaging can be useful for quick coordination (“Reminder: workday this Sat at 9am”). Personal calls from volunteer coordinators to key volunteers also strengthen relationships.
- **In-Person Gatherings:** Engagement here is high-touch. Host volunteer orientations, training workshops, and social gatherings (like a picnic or holiday party for volunteers). These face-to-face interactions reinforce their commitment.
- **Volunteer Appreciation:** Make a habit of thanking volunteers individually and collectively. This could be shout-outs in newsletters, small tokens of appreciation (like a t-shirt or hat after 50 hours of service), or awards for outstanding service. Recognizing volunteers publicly (e.g. a story in the newsletter: “Volunteer of the Month”) motivates them to stay involved and shows others that volunteering is valued.
- **Pathways to Leadership:** Keep volunteers engaged by offering “ladder” steps – e.g. an experienced volunteer might be invited to lead a volunteer crew or serve on a committee. Such opportunities should be communicated: “Interested in taking on a leadership volunteer role? Let’s talk!”

Volunteers, being highly invested, often become excellent **ambassadors**. Equip them with key talking points and encourage them to spread the word to friends (referrals are a great way to recruit new volunteers, who might eventually become donors too). In Door County, for instance, volunteers might be encouraged to invite neighbors or visiting friends to join a workday – tapping the county’s strong community networks to grow involvement.

### Partners and Stakeholders: Align Goals and Communicate Value

**Messaging:** When communicating with partner organizations, local officials, or businesses, the messaging should stress **shared value and mutual goals**. Partners want to know “what’s in it for us/our constituents?” and that the land trust is a reliable, credible collaborator. Key messages include highlighting the **community benefits** of conservation (economic benefits like tourism, ecosystem services like clean water, cultural and recreational value) and the **credibility** of the land trust (e.g. being an accredited organization, having community support). For example, in talking with a county board about a project, a land trust might frame it as *“This preserve will not only protect wildlife habitat, but also maintain the scenic landscapes that draw tourists and support local businesses – a win-win for the economy and environment.”* With other nonprofits, emphasize complementary missions (“By working together we can achieve outcomes that none of us could alone”). It’s often effective to reference broader initiatives or policies: if a land trust aligns its messaging with, say, county green infrastructure plans or state climate resilience goals, partners see the relevance.

For **policymakers**, messages should be concise, fact-based but also constituent-driven. E.g., “80% of local voters support protecting open space; our land trust can help you deliver that.” Storytelling can be used here too: share anecdotes of community members benefiting from conserved land (a family enjoying a park that was protected, a farmer grateful for help in preserving their farm) to give a human face to the partnership.

Demonstrating **professionalism and reciprocity** is key. Thank partners for their role, give them credit in communications, and make sure they are kept informed of progress. Partners need to feel that association with the land trust adds to their own success (be it public goodwill, meeting their mandates, or positive publicity).

**Channels & Engagement:** Partners are often engaged through more formal or targeted channels:

- **Direct Meetings and Committees:** Regular meetings (one-on-one with a town official, or multi-party coalition meetings) are fundamental. Having staff or board members sit on community committees (like a county open space committee) can ensure ongoing dialogue.
- **Presentations and Reports:** Create tailored slide decks or brief reports for partner audiences (e.g. an annual update to the City Council, or a joint press release with a corporate sponsor). These should use the language of that audience (economic data for a business group, education outcomes for a school partner, etc.).
- **Professional Networks:** Engage via professional networks or conferences (state land trust gatherings, local Chamber of Commerce events, Rotary clubs). Speaking at these venues can reach multiple partners at once.
- **Email Briefings or Partner Newsletter:** Some land trusts maintain a special e-newsletter for partners/stakeholders, focusing on high-level impact and opportunities. Or simply an email list to send important news (like policy alerts or major successes) to community leaders.
- **Social Media & Website (Public Announcements):** When a partnership yields something (a new preserve opening, a grant awarded), co-promote it. Tag partner organizations on social media. Put logos on the website for major partners. This public recognition not only thanks them but also shows others the breadth of support (which can attract new partners).
- **Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) and MOAs:** While not a channel per se, formal agreements can solidify partnerships and clarify communication protocols. Ensuring both sides know how they’ll share information and credit is part of the strategy.

Engagement with partners often involves maintaining a **stakeholder map** and plan. Using a stakeholder analysis framework (like mapping each stakeholder’s level of influence and interest) helps prioritize communication efforts

For instance, a local government agency with high influence and high interest in conservation needs frequent, collaborative engagement (perhaps even joint planning sessions), whereas a local business with high influence but lower interest might just need to be kept satisfied with occasional updates and opportunities to sponsor visible projects. This systematic approach ensures no important stakeholder falls through the cracks in communication.

### General Public (Community): Inspire and Educate Broadly

**Messaging:** For the wider community, the aim is to **raise awareness, build goodwill, and invite participation**. Messaging here tends to be more **educational and inspirational**, showcasing the land trust’s mission and why it matters to everyone. Key themes often include: the *benefits of conservation to the public* (clean water, scenic beauty, outdoor recreation, preserving the character of the community), *exciting news or stories* (wildlife sightings, new land acquisitions, upcoming events), and *calls to action* for general support (visit a preserve, attend an event, volunteer, donate, subscribe for updates). The tone is inclusive – we want every community member to feel they have a stake in local conservation, whether or not they are directly involved yet.

It’s also important to tailor messages to different segments of the public. For example, to engage younger people or those not traditionally reached, land trusts might highlight **relevance**: connecting conservation to issues like climate change resilience, outdoor recreation trends, or community health. In fact, climate messaging has been used by some land trusts to engage new audiences who care about climate action

[landtrustalliance.org](https://landtrustalliance.org/resources/learn/explore/communicating-about-climate-change/crafting-an-organizational-audience-profile?queryID=c7f8b02f86f212700d932ff823a8f574#:~:text=support%20organizations%20tackling%20the%20climate,crisis)

[landtrustalliance.org](https://landtrustalliance.org/resources/learn/explore/communicating-about-climate-change/crafting-an-organizational-audience-profile?queryID=c7f8b02f86f212700d932ff823a8f574#:~:text=resilience,4%20years)

. Similarly, culturally resonant framing can help reach diverse groups (for instance, emphasizing how protecting land honors cultural heritage or provides equitable access to nature). Using accessible language (no heavy scientific jargon) and visually engaging storytelling (beautiful images of local landscapes and people enjoying them) will make messages appealing to a broad base.

A classic example message for the public might be: *“Together, we’re ensuring that Door County’s most beautiful places – its forests, coasts, and wetlands – remain healthy and open for all to enjoy. Whether you’re hiking our trails, tasting local foods grown on protected farms, or simply proud to live in a community that values nature, **you are part of this success**. Here’s how you can get involved…”*. This kind of messaging connects conservation to everyday life and invites everyone in.

**Channels & Engagement:** Reaching the general public requires **multi-faceted outreach** across mass media and community touchpoints:

- **Social Media:** Platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter (X) are invaluable for reaching a wide audience. Conservation groups routinely use social media to “enhance and expand their impact by engaging new and existing supporters”. Social media is especially useful to reach **younger audiences or new folks** who might not visit the website or be on an email list. Regular posts with eye-catching visuals, short videos, and community hashtags (e.g. #LoveDoorCounty) can grow awareness. It’s important to interact (respond to comments, share user-generated content) to build an online community.

    [library.weconservepa.org](https://library.weconservepa.org/guides/155-social-media-basics-for-conservation-organizations#:~:text=match%20at%20L192%20makes%20social,event%20attendees%2C%20future%20staff%20members)
    
- **Website and Blog:** The website should serve as a hub for information on preserves, projects, and ways to get involved. A blog with stories or news can cater to those looking for more depth. SEO helps attract people searching for hikes or nature in the area – then they learn about the land trust.
- **Email Marketing:** Maintaining an email list for the general public (people who sign up for news or attend an event) allows direct communication of news and event invites. Segmenting the list by interest can further tailor content (e.g. a subset who indicated interest in birding could get bird-focused content).
- **Press and Media:** Press releases and media outreach ensure local newspapers, radio, or TV cover major announcements. Many in the community still consume local news media, so building relationships with reporters (providing good stories and expert quotes) can result in articles that reach thousands. For example, a land trust might pitch a story on “Family saves 100-year farm through Land Trust partnership” – which not only recognizes the landowner but educates readers about what land trusts do.
- **Events and Outreach Programs:** Community events are direct channels to the public. This includes guided hikes open to all, booths at farmers’ markets or fairs, educational lectures, or big annual events (like a “Conservation Celebration” picnic). These put a human face on the organization and allow two-way interaction. In Door County, an event like a nature preserve grand opening might draw locals and tourists alike and generate buzz.
- **Traditional Marketing:** Depending on the community, tactics like flyers on community bulletin boards, brochures in visitor centers, or even billboards can increase visibility. In a tourist-heavy area, having info available at tourism bureaus (e.g. Destination Door County’s visitor info) can reach visitors who love the area’s nature.
- **School and Youth Outreach:** Engaging young people through school partnerships, youth nature clubs, or scout groups can be part of public outreach. Today’s kids could become tomorrow’s volunteers and supporters, and they often influence their parents as well.

The strategy for the general public often aligns with building a **funnel**: first **inform** broadly, then invite interested individuals to a small action (sign up, attend something), then gradually deepen engagement. For instance, someone might first see a Facebook post about a beautiful trail, then click through to read a blog story, then join an email list, later come to a guided hike, and eventually become a member. This is essentially the marketing **engagement ladder** in action – moving individuals from awareness to involvement step by step.

Speaking of which, the **Nonprofit Ladder of Engagement** is a useful framework here. It visualizes supporters on a spectrum from low engagement (just aware or casually following) up to high engagement (actively advocating or leading)

[bonterratech.com](https://www.bonterratech.com/blog/nonprofit-ladder-of-engagement#:~:text=A%20ladder%20of%20engagement%20is,and%20engagement%20with%20your%20cause)

. Typical “rungs” on this ladder for a land trust might be:

*Observer*

(follows on social media) ->

*Participant*

(attends an event or visits a preserve) ->

*Volunteer*

->

*Donor*

->

*Evangelist/Advocate*

(recruits others, speaks publicly for the cause). The idea is to design communications that

**nudge people up the ladder**

. For example, social media followers (bottom rung) can be encouraged to subscribe to email or take a small action; volunteers can be asked if they’d like to also donate, etc. One guide illustrates a generic ladder: starting from just viewing content, to sharing it, to volunteering, to donating, to recurring giving, and finally advocating

[bonterratech.com](https://www.bonterratech.com/blog/nonprofit-ladder-of-engagement#:~:text=Image%3A%20An%20infographic%20listing%20the,100)

. Keeping this ladder in mind ensures the strategy has pathways for increasing engagement over the 5-year period.

## Frameworks and Tools for Audience Segmentation and Engagement

Developing and implementing a segmented communications strategy is much easier with proven frameworks and tools. Here are a few that conservation nonprofits commonly use:

- **Stakeholder Analysis Grid:** As mentioned, a stakeholder analysis matrix is a classic tool to map out different stakeholders and tailor engagement accordingly. One common approach is the **power vs. interest grid** – plotting stakeholders on a 2x2 matrix of high/low influence and high/low interest. For example, a major donor or local government official might be “High Influence, High Interest” (require significant personalized engagement), whereas the general public might be “Low Influence (individually) but High Interest” (warrant broad informative communication). The matrix helps prioritize: typically, *High Influence/High Interest* stakeholders are managed closely (regular personal communication), *High Influence/Low Interest* are kept satisfied (periodic check-ins, involve them only in key issues), *Low Influence/High Interest* are kept informed (newsletters, events to maintain enthusiasm), and *Low Influence/Low Interest* require minimal effort (perhaps occasional general outreach). By categorizing stakeholders this way, a land trust ensures efficient use of staff time and appropriate messaging levels for each group. **Tool:** Templates for stakeholder analysis are widely available (e.g. Miro’s Stakeholder Analysis Template). The Land Trust Alliance also offers a **Stakeholder Analysis Toolkit (2018)** with examples specific to land trusts (focusing on understanding your community and where support or opposition may lie).
    
    [miro.com](https://miro.com/templates/stakeholder-analysis/#:~:text=of%20a%202,teams%20as%20well%20as%20individuals)
    
    [miro.com](https://miro.com/templates/stakeholder-analysis/#:~:text=of%20a%202,teams%20as%20well%20as%20individuals)
    
- **Audience Persona Templates:** Creating detailed personas for key audience segments is a best practice in marketing that nonprofits have adopted. A persona goes beyond demographic info to include motivations, preferred communication style, and engagement triggers. For instance, a persona for **“Easement Eddie – the Conservation Landowner”** might note: 72 years old, owns 200 acres of woods; values legacy and wildlife; skeptical of government but trusts local community members; reads the local newspaper; best reached through an introduction by a neighbor and a follow-up farm visit; message that resonates – “protect your land for your grandchildren.” In contrast, **“Eco Emily – the Young Supporter”** could be: 27, new resident, loves hiking; values climate action and social media savvy; gets news from Instagram; best engaged by invitations to outdoor social events and seeing diverse representation; message that resonates – “join a community of young nature advocates making a difference locally.” By fleshing these out, staff and board can literally “picture” the audience when crafting messages. **Tools:** There are free persona templates (e.g. from marketing blogs or Canva) that one can adapt. The important elements include: Name, photo, background, goals, challenges/pains, values, preferred channels, and the key message or approach for that persona. Many organizations also involve team brainstorming to develop personas, ensuring a mix of perspectives (and sometimes even interviewing some real representatives of each segment for insights).
    
    [canva.com](https://www.canva.com/templates/s/user-persona/#:~:text=Free%20and%20customizable%20user%20persona,customize%20and%20share%20from%20Canva)
    
- **Engagement Ladder / Pyramid:** As discussed, the **ladder of engagement** is a conceptual framework to plot out how you will deepen engagement over time. Some organizations prefer an **Engagement Pyramid** – same idea but visualized as a pyramid (with many people at the bottom aware, and a few at the top as champions). Using this framework, you can set objectives for moving X% of people from one level to the next each year. For example, in year 1 you might aim to convert 10% of social media followers into email subscribers, or 50% of volunteers into donors. The ladder helps in planning **targeted actions for each rung**. For instance, to move someone from “Aware” to “Engaged,” you might run a campaign offering a free guided hike to anyone who signs up for the newsletter (thus converting passive followers into identifiable leads). To move volunteers into donors, you could create a special “volunteer thank-you fund” drive referencing their service (“You’ve given your time, now you can amplify your impact with a gift – and a generous donor will match volunteer donations”). The ladder/pyramid framework ensures you have strategies at each level and can track progress. **Tools:** Various nonprofits have shared engagement ladder models (Bonterra’s guide provides an example of ladder rungs). Simply sketching it out for your organization and overlaying actual numbers (e.g. # of people at each stage now, and desired # in 5 years) can be a powerful planning tool.
    
    [bonterratech.com](https://www.bonterratech.com/blog/nonprofit-ladder-of-engagement#:~:text=Image%3A%20An%20infographic%20listing%20the,100)
    
- **Messaging Frameworks:** Consistency in tailored messaging can be maintained with frameworks like a **message matrix**. This is a table where one dimension is the audience segment and the other is the key message points or value propositions. Each cell then contains the tailored phrasing for that audience. For example, a core message might be “Land conservation benefits the community,” but in the matrix you’d articulate it for donors (focus on impact and legacy), for landowners (focus on preserving what they love about their land), for public (focus on recreational and scenic benefits), etc. The matrix can also include do’s and don’ts per audience (e.g. with landowners, do use “your land, your legacy,” don’t use technical terms like “biodiversity hotspot”). Having this written out ensures all communicators (staff, board, volunteers) stay on the same page when speaking to different groups.
- **Tools for Managing Contacts and Segments:** On a practical level, a robust **CRM (Constituent Relationship Management)** system or at least an organized database is important for segmented messaging. Nonprofits use CRMs like Salesforce, Neon One, Bloomerang, etc., to tag contacts by type (donor, volunteer, landowner, etc.), track their interactions, and even automate segmented email campaigns. For example, your email marketing software can send slightly different newsletters to donors versus general public by using list segmentation. On social media, tools like Facebook allow targeting posts or ads to specific demographics or interests (e.g. a boosted post about a hunting program could target users interested in hunting and conservation within your state). Utilizing these technical tools makes executing a segmented strategy feasible.
- **Frameworks for Evaluation:** Finally, to ensure all this is working, adopt a cycle of *plan – implement – evaluate – adjust* (often referred to in nonprofit communications as a version of PDCA or just continuous improvement). One framework specific to conservation education/engagement is the **“Tools of Engagement” toolkit by Audubon & USFWS**, which outlines planning steps and even an **engagement spectrum** (from merely informing people to fully empowering them in conservation). It includes planning worksheets and emphasizes setting goals and metrics for each engagement effort. Land trusts could use such a toolkit to structure their campaign planning – for example, Section 7 of the TELE guide (Tools for Engaging Landowners Effectively) is all about “Getting the Word Out” with multiple touches, which is essentially a framework to plan multi-channel outreach to a segment. Embracing these structured approaches ensures the communications strategy is not ad-hoc but carefully orchestrated.

In summary, these frameworks and tools – from identifying stakeholders and personas, to charting engagement paths, to using modern CRMs and toolkits – provide a roadmap for more effective and efficient communications. Adopting them in a Notion workspace (for example, embedding persona templates or stakeholder grids in the Notion pages) can make the 5-year strategy concrete and actionable for the team.

## Metrics and Benchmarks for Segmented Messaging Effectiveness

To gauge the success of a segmented communications strategy, land trusts should define **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** and track benchmarks over time. Effective evaluation looks at both **engagement outcomes** (are people responding to our messages?) and ultimate **behavior outcomes** (are people doing what we hope – donating, conserving land, volunteering?). Below are common metrics used, along with typical benchmarks and considerations for each segment:

- **Email Open and Click-Through Rates:** If you’re sending targeted emails (e.g. a special update to volunteers, or an appeal to donors), track the open rate (% who open the email) and click-through rate (% who click a link or call-to-action). Nonprofit industry benchmarks for open rates are often around 20–30% depending on list quality; segmented lists can perform better since content is more relevant. For instance, a segmented email to lapsed donors with a tailored message might have a higher click rate than a generic blast. Monitoring these metrics by segment helps identify what content resonates (e.g. maybe volunteers have a 40% open rate on volunteer newsletters – indicating strong interest – whereas general news emails might be lower, signaling room to tweak content).
- **Conversion Rates:** This measures how many people take a desired action. It could be the % of recipients who donate after a campaign, or the % of event attendees who sign up as members. For example, if you run a social media ad targeted to young adults inviting them to download a hiking guide in exchange for an email address, the conversion rate would be how many actually sign up on the landing page. Generally, small, well-targeted campaigns have higher conversion (maybe 5-15%), while broad ones are lower (<5%). You can set internal benchmarks like “convert 10% of event participants to email subscribers” or “get 50 new donors from our spring mailer to landowners.”
- **Website and Social Media Engagement:** Metrics such as website page views, time on site, or specific page hits (like the “Landowner Programs” page) can show what segments are seeking. Social media metrics (followers, likes, shares, comments) indicate overall public interest and engagement. You might break this down: e.g., track growth in followers in certain demographics if the platforms provide (Facebook Insights can show age breakdown of followers – are you gaining the 20-35 age group if that’s a goal?). An engaged audience will interact: look for increases in shares and comments on posts that were tailored to specific interests (say a post about bird migration got lots of shares – that tells you birders are an active sub-audience). Also note when targeting diverse audiences: ensure metrics reflect reaching those communities (maybe track engagement on posts that were bilingual or featuring diverse images).
- **Event Participation Metrics:** For community engagement, measure event attendance numbers and participant feedback. Are volunteer workdays filling up? Is the annual meeting attracting more than just the same old crowd? Track how many *new* people vs. returning people attend events – a segmented strategy should bring in new faces. If you hold targeted events (like a landowner workshop), track the number of attendees and how many requests for follow-up (like site visits) result.
- **Donor and Membership Metrics:** These include number of active donors, donor **retention rate** (what % of last year’s donors gave again this year), and donation upgrades. Industry benchmarks: overall nonprofit donor retention often hovers around 50% annually (though it’s been declining recently, with new donor retention sometimes as low as ~20%). For land trusts, which often have loyal members, you might aim higher – e.g. maintain a 60%+ renewal rate for members, and a certain % conversion of first-time donors to second-year donors (since second-year retention is critical). Also measure how segmented efforts affect giving: did a special “volunteers become donors” campaign yield X new donors? Did major donor revenue increase after implementing personalized stewardship communications?
    
    [afpglobal.org](https://afpglobal.org/sites/default/files/attachments/blog/FEP%20Q3%20REPORT%202024.pdf#:~:text=,The%20drop%20was%20most)
    
- **Volunteer Metrics:** Track number of active volunteers, volunteer hours contributed, and retention of volunteers year to year. If engagement is good, volunteer numbers and hours should grow or at least remain strong. Also track if volunteers are moving up the engagement ladder (for example, how many volunteers became donors or took on leadership roles). A benchmark might be something like “25% of volunteers also donate financially” – and see if that rises with targeted messaging.
- **Landowner Engagement Metrics:** This could include number of inquiries from landowners, number of acres protected through donations or easements, or participation in landowner programs. If you start a landowner newsletter, what’s the sign-up rate and open rate? If you run a mailing to landowners about conservation options, how many respond or request a meeting? These are longer-term metrics since decisions on land can take years, but tracking uptick in inquiries or workshop attendance is a good leading indicator.
- **Surveys and Feedback:** Quantitative metrics are vital, but qualitative feedback matters too. Conducting surveys for different segments can reveal satisfaction and areas to improve. For instance, a donor survey might ask if they feel well-informed about the impact of their gifts; a volunteer survey could ask if they feel appreciated and what other roles they’d like to take. High satisfaction is itself a metric. Likewise, simply asking “How did you hear about us?” on event sign-ups or membership forms can help attribute which channels are effective (e.g. 30% heard via social media, 20% from a friend, etc.).

Many of these metrics can be compiled into a **dashboard** for regular review (quarterly or annually). The communications strategy can set target benchmarks (like “gain 100 new social media followers per month” or “achieve an email open rate above nonprofit average of ~25%

[fiftyandfifty.org](https://fiftyandfifty.org/are-your-donor-communication-strategies-effective/#:~:text=Evaluating%20the%20effectiveness%20of%20your,a%20look%20at%20these%20metrics)

”).

Importantly, measure **by segment** where possible. As one guide suggests, “take a close look” through segmentation – you might find, for example, an email campaign converted more donors of a particular age or giving level

[fiftyandfifty.org](https://fiftyandfifty.org/are-your-donor-communication-strategies-effective/#:~:text=By%20evaluating%20all%20of%20these,insights%20to%20guide%20further%20communications)

. Such insights can then refine your strategy (maybe younger donors responded to a different message than older ones, so next time you segment by age with tailored content).

**Benchmark Sources:** Nonprofit communications benchmarks (like the annual M+R Benchmarks study) can provide reference points, such as average email metrics, social media growth rates, etc., for organizations of similar size. Also, comparing year-over-year for your own org is useful – improvement over your past self is the goal, even if external benchmarks serve as a rough guide.

Finally, beyond numbers, look at **outcomes**: increased awareness (perhaps measured by a survey of community attitudes), policy wins (did communications help pass a funding measure?), or conservation results (did engaging landowners lead to more land protected?). Tie your communications metrics to these mission outcomes where possible, to show that segmented, strategic messaging is not just creating vanity metrics but contributing to real conservation impact.

## Case Studies and Examples

Integrating best practices often benefits from seeing real-world examples. Here are a few brief case studies and tools in action:

- **Urban Land Trust Diversifying Its Base (Southeast US):** As referenced earlier, a land trust in a fast-growing urban area realized their supporters were not representative of the whole community. They developed audience profiles for who they had versus who they wanted to reach. **Current segments** were older, white donors and connected landowners – so their strategy for these folks centered on *deepening loyalty* (personal invitations to events, showcasing donor stories, and connecting conservation to issues they care about like climate impacts on their land). **New segments** they sought were younger professionals and diverse urban residents – for these, they crafted *new messaging about climate resilience and community relevance*, and used *new channels* (recruiting social media ambassadors to create content, hosting nature walks in the city). Over a few years, they tracked increases in social media engagement from the target age group and saw a small but growing number of younger donors and volunteers (a key benchmark of success). This case illustrates using segmentation to **broaden outreach** while still tending to core supporters.

- **Donor Segmentation by Interest – “Birders vs. Paddlers” Example:** A conservation nonprofit noticed that a significant subset of its members were avid bird watchers, while another subset loved kayaking and river activities. They created two “affinity segments.” All members got general communications, but birders would sometimes get bonus content – e.g. an email about a new bird habitat project or invites to birding outings – whereas paddling enthusiasts got invites to river cleanups or kayak days. Each segment saw messaging that spoke to their passion (“Save habitat for the warblers you love” vs “Keep our waters clear for your next paddle”). This led to higher engagement: the birders opened emails at a 10% higher rate than the general list when the content was tailored. It also helped fundraising: when a new bird sanctuary acquisition was announced, they highlighted it to the birding segment, resulting in strong donations from that group. The takeaway: **segmenting by supporter interest** can boost relevance and response.
- **Tools for Engaging Landowners Effectively (TELE):** The TELE program (mentioned earlier) provides a case study in how a framework can guide outreach. For example, in one TELE case, a land trust in New England used TELE’s social marketing approach to target “Woodland Retreat Owners” (a segment identified by research as conservation-friendly but not very active). They developed a persona (“The Nature Lover with Busy Life”) and tailored a campaign with messaging about easy, family-friendly stewardship activities and preserving the beauty of the woods. They sent a series of postcards (with art and simple tips) and followed up with a personal invitation to a forest field day. The result was a notable increase in participation in stewardship programs among that segment. TELE’s guidance to *identify specific landowner segments and their motivators* was credited with this success – it was more effective than their earlier generic mailings. This case reinforces the value of research-based segmentation (in this case, psychographic segments of landowners) and a mix of direct mail plus personal follow-up for reaching rural audiences.

- **“Gaining Ground” National Campaign (2023):** The Land Trust Alliance’s **Gaining Ground** campaign provides an example of a coordinated messaging effort with tools for local land trusts. This campaign, launched in 2023, is a nationwide marketing push to raise awareness of land trusts and their role in communities. It includes a toolkit (with research-backed messaging, graphics, and templates) that land trusts can use in their own communications. For instance, it likely contains key messages that tested well with general audiences (e.g. emphasizing how land trusts help build healthier communities and a healthier planet). A Door County Land Trust or others might piggyback on this campaign to amplify outreach in their area. The case here is about consistency and collaboration: by using shared messaging themes and timing (e.g. October 2023 launch events across states), individual land trusts benefited from a larger narrative (people heard similar messages multiple times, reinforcing impact). Early metrics from Gaining Ground (hypothetically) could include increased web traffic to find local land trusts and more social media buzz about “land trusts” as a topic. It shows how segmented messaging (each land trust tailoring the national materials to their local audiences) combined with a unified theme can be powerful.

- **Volunteer to Donor Pipeline – A Success Story:** A mid-sized land trust in the Midwest noticed that while they had many volunteers, few were donating. They implemented an engagement ladder strategy specifically to move volunteers up. First, they segmented volunteers in their database and sent a special communication acknowledging their volunteer contributions and sharing a story of a volunteer who also became a donor, explaining how it enhanced their impact. They then offered a matching challenge grant exclusively for volunteers (“Every dollar you donate will be matched, and as volunteers you know better than anyone the impact it will have on the land.”). This personal approach yielded a 25% response – many volunteers made a first-time donation, and some commented that they appreciated being asked in a respectful way that honored their time. Over the next year, those who became donor-volunteers were given special updates and eventually invited to a legacy circle event, nurturing them further. This example underlines the importance of recognizing the *multiple identities* supporters can have (volunteer, donor, advocate) and how tailored messaging can encourage them to deepen their involvement.
- **Digital Engagement Tracking:** One land trust invested in better analytics and discovered, for example, that their segmented email about “Top 5 Fall Hikes on Our Preserves” (targeted to people who had attended a hike event or indicated outdoor recreation interest) had a 45% open rate and drove a spike in website visits to trail maps. However, an email titled “Annual Fund Appeal” to the general list had a lower open rate. Learning from this, they adjusted the appeal email subject for different segments the next time: for hikers, they mentioned trail improvements in the subject; for longtime donors, they referenced “Your 5 Years of Impact – Will You Renew?” As a result, open and click rates improved in each segment compared to the one-size-fits-all message. This mini case shows how **A/B testing and analytics by segment** can refine messaging for better outcomes.

In all these examples, a few themes emerge: *know your audience, meet them where they are, speak to what they value, and continuously learn and adapt.* The organizations that saw success did so by being intentional in segmenting (by demographics, behavior, or interest), by using the right mix of channels (from postcards to social media to in-person chats), and by measuring what happened and feeding that back into strategy.

## Framework Spotlight: Whole Communities Framework

We are incorporating the **Whole Communities Framework** to evaluate our stakeholder engagement efforts. This lens (adapted from national conservation equity tools) helps ensure our messaging and programming aren’t unintentionally centering only the most privileged voices.

This lens bridges traditional audience segments with a justice-forward perspective, offering a strategic way to reflect on **who we’re currently reaching—and who we might be missing**.

## **Conclusion**

By segmenting its audiences and tailoring messages and engagement strategies accordingly, a land trust can significantly boost its outreach effectiveness, build stronger relationships, and ultimately advance its conservation mission. The communications plan for the next five years should be rooted in these best practices – identifying who the key audience groups are, crafting personas and message frameworks for each, employing appropriate channels (from traditional media for older donors to Instagram for young advocates, from personal meetings for landowners to community events for the public), and using tools like stakeholder maps, engagement ladders, and analytics to stay on track.

Implementing this in a structured way (the Notion workspace can host profiles, calendars, content plans, and metric dashboards for each segment) will help ensure the strategy is a living document, guiding day-to-day communications as well as big campaigns. With regular evaluation, the land trust can adjust tactics – perhaps the first year’s focus is on shoring up donor communications and volunteer engagement processes, the next on outreach to new audiences like young families or diverse communities, all while monitoring metrics to see what’s working.

By following the guidance and examples outlined above, a U.S. land trust (whether in Door County or elsewhere) can move from a generic outreach approach to a savvy, segmented communications strategy. This means every message hits closer to home for its intended audience – inspiring landowners to conserve, donors to give generously, volunteers to bring friends along, partners to sing praises, and the broader public to become supporters of keeping lands and waters protected for generations to come.
