# 🌍 DEI Strategy for Communications & Website

This page outlines how diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) principles will guide DCLT’s communications and website strategy. It serves as a standalone strategic reference and is meant to inform voice, visuals, UX, and outreach across all audience segments.

## 🎯 Purpose & Vision

To integrate DEI values into the core of DCLT’s communications—ensuring our digital presence reflects and welcomes the full diversity of the communities we serve, respects lived experiences, and actively works to remove barriers to engagement.

## 🧭 Focus Areas

- **Representation**
    
    Ensure visual and narrative inclusion across age, ability, ethnicity, income level, and lived experience.
    
- **Accessibility**
    
    Comply with WCAG 2.1 AA standards. Use plain language, alt text, mobile-first design, and clear navigation paths.
    
- **Cultural Responsiveness**
    
    Avoid extractive storytelling. Center community voices and land-based relationships from a variety of perspectives.
    
- **Tone & Language**
    
    Use inclusive, non-paternalistic language. Shift from savior framing to shared stewardship.
