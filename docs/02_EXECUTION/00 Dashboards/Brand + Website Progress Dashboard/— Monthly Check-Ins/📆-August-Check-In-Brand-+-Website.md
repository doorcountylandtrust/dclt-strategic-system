# 📆 August Check-In: Brand + Website

### **🟢 This week will be successful if…**

- A clear decision is made on **brand direction and visual tone**, or we narrow to a final two directions
- Website **wireframes are underway**, with at least homepage and one interior page started
- Remaining **major roadmap items** are mapped into the task tracker for August–October

---

### **🔑 Key Updates / FYI**

- Focus Groups 1–3 complete; key takeaways synthesized and incorporated into brand timeline
- Visual roadmap now live in Notion and shared with [boss or team]; includes parallel timelines for Brand + Website
- Task Tracker being cleaned up and scaffolded for full lifecycle tracking (including backfilling annual rhythms like 2026 ad placement planning)
- Preserve Explorer MVP milestone met (map + cards rendering live); continuing UX/React build-out

---

### **🗣 Items for Discussion**

- Pebble Beach Signage
- Final **decision-making process** for brand visual direction (who, how, when)
- Do we want one **consolidated Brand + Website Progress Dashboard**, or maintain separate Timeline & Status hubs?
- What are the **editorial or executive review checkpoints** from now through launch (for assets, designs, layouts)?

---

### **🧊 Backburner / Ongoing**

- Finish entering all project tasks into the tracker (phases, dependencies, annuals, CRM, integrations)
- Build supporting materials for the **Figma design system** (e.g. nav, buttons, tokens)
- Begin planning for **soft launch communications** (timing, tone, how to tell the story of the redesign)
