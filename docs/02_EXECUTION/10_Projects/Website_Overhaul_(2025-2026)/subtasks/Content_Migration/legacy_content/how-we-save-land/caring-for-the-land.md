# Caring for the Land

> “…the activity or job of protecting and being responsible for something, the careful and responsible management of something entrusted to one’s care.”  
> — *Merriam-Webster Dictionary, 2017*

It is through stewardship that protection in perpetuity becomes possible.  
The Door County Land Trust has a long-term commitment to the land, to our mission, and to the Door County community. Stewardship is our commitment to the future of the environment for all.

Through stewardship, we will leave a balanced and wild natural landscape, where we have a sense of place, and on which all life depends.

## Restoring and Maintaining Ecological Balance

### Restoring Forest Habitat

Before the first settlers arrived, Door County was forested from shore to shore with cedar, hemlock, fir, spruce, and other trees. Over time, forests were logged, burned, and cleared for agriculture — disrupting the ecological balance.

Now, steep cliffs and low-lying wetlands offer a window to the past. Native trees filter water, shade out invasive species, and provide essential habitat.

**Reforestation projects** help by:
- Replanting native trees
- Creating wildlife corridors
- Buffering run-off and erosion

### Monitoring and Removing Invasive Species

Not all green is good. Invasive plants disrupt native habitats, outcompete rare species, and harm wildlife.

**Examples:**
- Honeysuckle berries sicken birds
- Buckthorn acidifies wetlands, harming amphibians
- Some invasives emit toxins to kill other plants

The Land Trust:
- Monitors spread
- Plans eradication
- Reintroduces native species

Restoration is a long-term process.  
Invasive species eradication is only the beginning.

Volunteers:
- Maintain trails and signage
- Monitor plant and wildlife populations
- Remove invasive species
- Join a crew of people committed to place-based care

### Maintaining Trails and Public Access

DCLT preserves are free and open to the public every day of the year.  
The team maintains trails for:
- Hiking
- Wildlife observation
- Snowshoeing
- Low-impact recreation

This work is volunteer-powered.

### 🔬 Research at the Nature Preserves

The Land Trust hosts research by partner organizations on rare and threatened species.  
Findings are shared with DCLT and inform conservation work.

### 🦌 Hunting and Ecological Balance

The Land Trust works with local hunters to manage deer and turkey populations, which can disrupt forest health.

Hunting follows state regulations and guidelines set by the **Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Fund**.
