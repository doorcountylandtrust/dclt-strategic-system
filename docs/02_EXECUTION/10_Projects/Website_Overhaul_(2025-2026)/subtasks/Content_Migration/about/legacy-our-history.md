# History, Milestones & Who We Are

## Our Mission

> Protecting Door County’s exceptional lands and waters…forever.

- [ ] **Note:** This was the mission headline. Needs alignment with current brand tone/strategy.

---


Since our inception in 1986, the Door County Land Trust has worked to preserve, maintain and enhance lands that contribute significantly to the scenic beauty, open space, and ecological integrity of Door County. In pursuit of this mission, we have earned a reputation as one of the Midwest’s premier conservation organizations. We have worked with scores of landowners to protect more than 9,100 acres of fields, forests, farmlands, orchards, wetlands and shoreline. We are a local, non-profit, non-governmental organization supported by more than 2,800 households who love Door County and share a concern for its future.


## Our Community
> The Land Trust exists because of the excellent community support we receive. Along with our main supporters, we work hand-in-hand with Door County landowners to create land protection solutions for each individual situation.

## Our Solid foundation
> From fiscal responsibility to fair and transparent land dealings to collaborations with other conservation groups, we are an organization built on a rock solid foundation. The Land Trust prides itself on having adopted a host of internal policies to ensure that all activities of the organization are carried out with integrity and diligence.

## Our Partnerships
> We have forged important and lasting partnerships with other local land conservation groups. The Nature Conservancy, The Ridges Sanctuary, Crossroads at Big Creek, The Clearing and the Land Trust all work together to further the collective goal of sustaining a healthy ecosystem and high quality of life. We also partner with government agencies, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and local townships to protect properties of highest priority in Door County.

## Board of Directors and Staff
> The Land Trust is guided by an involved and energetic Board of Directors comprised of community leaders with passionate commitment, endless enthusiasm, visionary leadership, and wisdom. Our 12 professional staff members are dedicated to protecting the exceptional lands and waters of Door County, and fostering connections between the land and the community that offer inspiration, education, and partnerships that further conservation efforts in Door County. In addition to our staff, we have a volunteer corps of over 250 dedicated individuals.

## How We Work

> The Land Trust protects land in three primary ways...

- **We purchase properties**
    We <!-- BROKEN LINK: [purchase properties](https://doorcountylandtrust.org/how-we-save-land/protect-your-land/#bargain_sales) -->. Purchases are conducted only on lands that are identified as high priority in terms of ecological and/or scenic significance.

- **We accept land donations**
    We accept land donations from landowners who wish to see their properties permanently protected.

- **We hold conservation easements**
    We enter into conservation easement agreements with private property owners. These permanent agreements restrict the type and amount of development that can take place on the property. The land continues to remain under the ownership of the landowner while the Land Trust has the permanent responsibility to monitor and enforce the terms of the conservation easements


All lands that we consider protecting through any of these three methods must meet the terms of our Land Acceptance Policy.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What is the total acreage permanently protected in all of Door County?

Approximately 31,000 acres. There are more than 300,000 acres in Door County so this represents about 10% of the land under permanent protection. In comparison, the State of Wisconsin averages about 16% of lands protected and accessible to the public.

### How Does the Land Trust Fund its Work?

Program and Operations: Member donations fund nearly 85% of our program and operational costs, including most land stewardship expenses. Program grants, event income and income from our investments make up the remaining 15%.

Land Acquisitions: To help us purchase properties of high ecological and scenic value, we apply for state and federal land acquisition grants. Wisconsin’s Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Fund is a major source of grant funding for our land acquisitions. We also apply for grants to help us carry out large-scale ecological restoration efforts at our nature preserves. We rely on membership contributions to match the state and federal land acquisition grants we receive as most grants require a 50% match in private donations.

### How Does Land Preservation Impact Property Taxes?

Of the more than 7,000 acres protected by the Land Trust, about 2,800 acres are on the property tax rolls. Conservation easement agreements keep land in private ownership and thus on the tax rolls. In addition, some of the acreage owned by the Door County Land Trust remains on the tax rolls.

For lands owned by the Door County Land Trust, the majority of acreage is tax-exempt through a state law enabling land conservation organizations to apply for property-tax exemptions. This status is granted if the property is open to the public and provides habitat for native plants and animals. Tax-exempt status is only granted if the property provides public value in return. In the case of land conservation, the public gains established hiking preserves, hunting and fishing areas, scenic open space, and ecological services such as water filtration and habitat protection.

Preserving lands for scenic beauty and outdoor recreation is critical to maintaining a healthy countywide economy and for keeping property taxes in check, according to a 2004 study that analyzed the impact of different land uses on the property tax burden of local property owners and municipalities. The study found that developed lands cost a community more in services than they pay in taxes. Open space (fields, forests and farmlands), on the other hand, actually helps subsidize residential development by paying more in taxes than they use in services.

### Is the Public Allowed Access on Land Trust Preserves?

Yes! All of the lands owned by the Land Trust are open to the public. The Door County Land Trust’s thirteen largest nature preserves offer more than 27 miles of marked hiking trails that are featured in our Hiking Trails of the Door County Land Trust map. Our nature preserves are open for hiking, fishing, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, wildlife observation, hunting and low-impact, non-motorized recreational activities.

Generally, our conservation easement-protected properties are not open to the public but many landowners grant the Land Trust the right to lead guided hikes.

### Is Hunting Allowed on Land Trust Preserves?


Most of the land we own and manage is open to hunting. Hunting helps the Land Trust fulfill its land management goals by reducing the impact that the abundance of deer and turkey have on our native flora and fauna and also serves to connect our protected lands with more local community members. Depending on the preserve, there are different hunting allowances and different hunting seasons that are open. Hunters are asked to register their intent to hunt on Land Trust owned properties so the land trust is aware of who is on our lands and how many hunters use our program. Click here to view the land trust hunting webpage. Guidelines for safe hiking during hunting season can be found on land trust preserve webpages.

### Are dogs allowed on Land Trust nature preserves?

Dogs are allowed on Land Trust nature preserves so long as they are leashed. Hunting dogs actively engaged in hunting may be off-leash but must be under control and in voice command of the owner at all times.

### Is the Door County Land Trust active in “political campaigns or endorsements”?

No. Since its inception, the Land Trust has been solely focused on working with landowners and the local community to protect the Door County’s exceptional lands and waters. We have stayed out of politics and that has served us well. Whether a landowner or a Land Trust supporter who cares about the future of Door County’s beautiful landscapes is a Republican, Democrat, or an Independent, they have a place under the Land Trust umbrella. By not diverting organizational resources to supporting local, state or federal political campaigns, all of our resources are spent protecting and caring for the lands that matter to us most.

## Our Beginnings

> In the mid-1980s, some members of the Door County Environmental Council were concerned with growing development and the lack of land protection options for county landowners. They sent two representatives to Washington D.C. for the very first meeting of regional land trusts from across the country. At this national Land Trust Rally, the representatives were introduced to the concept of land trusts and learned how to establish a local land trust in Door County. Shortly after their return, on June 7th, 1986, the Door County Land Trustees was incorporated and held its first official meeting. Virtually unknown in the county, with little money and only a handful of supporters, the future was uncertain for this fledgling organization.

> But…in November of 1986, Baileys Harbor landowner Ruth Neuman had faith in the land trust ideal and became the first person in Door County to donate a conservation easement agreement to the Land Trustees. Her 115-acre parcel became the first property protected by the newly-formed organization.

## Part of a Growing Movement...
> In 1950, fewer than 50 local land trusts existed in the country. Today, they number over 1,700. Across the country, local land trusts have permanently protected over 47 million acres of our nation’s most treasured landscapes, double what was protected just five years ago. This figure grows by approximately 800,000 acres each year.
