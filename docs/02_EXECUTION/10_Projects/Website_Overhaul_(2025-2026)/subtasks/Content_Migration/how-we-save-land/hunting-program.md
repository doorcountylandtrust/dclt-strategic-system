# Hunting Program at Door County Land Trust Preserves

Door County Land Trust preserves accommodate a wide variety of public uses including hiking, canoeing, cross country skiing, scientific research and hunting. In order to create a safe and enjoyable environment for all visitors to our preserves, we ask hunters to review and comply with our hunting program rules.

Hunters play an important role as conservation partners with the Door County Land Trust by helping regulate and maintain the populations of white-tailed deer and turkeys. The overabundance of these species negatively impacts ecosystem health on lands we protect. Hunters also provide valuable information from the field that is used in making management decisions for Land Trust preserves.

Please be aware that lands on which the Door County Land Trust holds a conservation easement are private property and the Land Trust does not have the authority to grant permission to hunt on these lands.

There are a few properties owned by the Door County Land Trust that are not open for any hunting seasons. These areas are usually small in size, located in residential neighborhoods, or too ecologically sensitive for off-trail foot traffic.

However, most of the lands owned by the Land Trust are open for hunting.  The list of Door County Land Trust Preserves at which hunting is permitted, the seasons permitted and links to printable hunting maps are located at the bottom of this page. Also keep in mind that The Nature Conservancy and WI-DNR allow hunting. That information is available on their websites.

If you are interested in hunting on lands owned by the Door County Land Trust, please carefully review the hunting rules below.

## 📜 Rules for Hunting on Land Trust Preserves


    - Prior to the hunt, hunters are requested to contact the Land Trust by completing the Hunter Information Form on our website.

    - Use of Door County Land Trust Preserves is a privilege extended to all legally-permitted hunters who abide by the rules and regulations of the WI-DNR and the Door County Land Trust. Failure to do so may result in loss of hunting privilege and if warranted, referral to the WI-DNR and/or Door County Sheriff for possible enforcement action.

    - Portable hunting stands and structures (including trail cameras) are permitted for day use only and must be removed each night. All stands and structures must contain ownership information (name, address and phone number). If a stand or other structure is left overnight it will be dismantled and removed by staff or preserve stewards.

    - The following activities are not allowed:
        - cutting trees or vegetation or removing brush from properties
        - baiting
        - motorized vehicles of any kind

    - Hunters must respect adjacent private property. If a hunter needs to follow a wounded animal onto
    private lands, prior permission must be obtained from the landowner.

    - Dogs actively engaged in hunting may be off leash, except that all dogs must be kept on leash from
    April 15 to July 31 to protect ground-nesting birds.

    - Hunters are asked to help “keep an eye” on things when hunting and to inform the Land Trust if there are any activities taking place on the property of which we should be aware.
