# Caring for the Land (Stewardship)

**Purpose**  
To showcase how Door County Land Trust protects, restores, and actively cares for the lands under its protection — and to invite deeper involvement from supporters, volunteers, and donors.

## What Stewardship Means

Land protection doesn’t stop at acquisition. Stewardship is the lifelong commitment to care for forests, wetlands, and shorelines — ensuring that the ecosystems we protect today remain healthy and resilient tomorrow.

Our team works year-round to restore native habitats, monitor ecological health, and ensure that preserves remain safe and welcoming for both wildlife and people.

## Stewardship Stories

> “I never thought pulling weeds could be this satisfying.”  
> — Stew Crew Volunteer, 2023

Each preserve has its own story — and challenges. From battling invasive reed canary grass in coastal wetlands to restoring rare alvar habitats near the escarpment, our team adapts to each landscape’s needs.

**Optional Modules:**
- Link to story spotlight (e.g., *Restoring Legacy at Clay Banks*)
- Before/after photo slider (if supported)
- Volunteer photo gallery

## Why It Matters
