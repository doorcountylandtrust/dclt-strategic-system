# Partner Transfers

Not every conservation success ends with DCLT holding the deed.

Sometimes, the best outcome for nature and the community is to transfer protected land to another organization—such as a county park system, a state agency, or a partner nonprofit.

## What Are Partner Transfers?

Partner Transfers are lands that DCLT protects—through purchase, donation, or easement—and then transfers to another long-term steward.

These transfers are strategic. They often:

- Expand public access through park or trail systems
- Help municipalities manage important local resources
- Align with state and federal habitat goals
- Free up DCLT capacity to take on new projects

## Examples of Successful Transfers

### Grand View Park
Land protected by DCLT and transferred to the Town of Liberty Grove to create a scenic public park with long-term protections in place.

### Schwartz Lake Preserve
DCLT acquired key parcels around this ecologically sensitive lake, ensured permanent protection, and partnered with the Wisconsin DNR for ongoing care.

(Optional: add local case studies or quotes from agency partners.)

Every acre of protected land counts—no matter who holds the title.

Partner Transfers allow DCLT to:

- Act quickly when land is at risk
