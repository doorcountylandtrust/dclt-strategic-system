# Research & Partnerships

Scientific research strengthens our ability to care for the land—and collaboration helps us go further, faster.

Door County Land Trust partners with scientists, universities, and agencies to better understand our unique ecosystems and to ensure every decision is rooted in data, not guesswork.

## Why We Do It

Conservation is more than protecting land—it’s about stewarding it wisely. Our work is guided by field data, species monitoring, and ecological research to ensure we’re supporting biodiversity and climate resilience for generations to come.

## Research in Action

### Pitcher’s Thistle Study
A federally threatened dune species that relies on intact shoreline ecosystems. We partner with U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service and regional botanists to monitor population health and habitat conditions.

### Pollinator Research
Working with local beekeepers and entomologists, we evaluate native pollinator abundance and use that data to guide plantings and invasive species removal.

### Forest Composition & Climate Resilience
University partners help us study forest regeneration after invasive species management and storm events. These insights inform how we design long-term stewardship plans.
