## Overview Block: Why Land Gifts Matter

Door County’s most iconic protected lands — cedar forests, escarpment bluffs, rare wetlands — were made possible through landowners like you. Whether it’s a full donation, a partial sale, or a bequest in your will, there are many ways to protect the natural character of your land forever.

## Options for Landowners

Use this block to explain each route in plain, respectful language. Include subtle guidance on which route fits which situation.

### Full Land Donation  
Gift your property outright for permanent protection.

- **Best for:** Those who no longer need the land, want to ensure protection, and may benefit from tax deductions.
- **Key benefit:** Simple, full legacy. No sale negotiation needed.

### Bargain Sale  
Sell your land below market value — part donation, part sale.

- **Best for:** Those needing partial income or offsetting other giving.
- **Key benefit:** Combines impact with financial flexibility.

### Bequest in Will  
Name DCLT as a beneficiary in your estate planning.

- **Best for:** Long-term planners who wish to retain use during their lifetime.
- **Key benefit:** Leave a lasting legacy with minimal paperwork today.
