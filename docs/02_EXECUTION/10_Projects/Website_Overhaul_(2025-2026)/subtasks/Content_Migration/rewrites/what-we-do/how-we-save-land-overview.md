# How We Save Land

_Door County is a rare and remarkable place. Protecting it takes long-term vision, diverse tools, and local care._

## Three Ways We Save Land

Our work falls into three main strategies. Each plays a role in protecting Door County’s future:

### 1. Nature Preserves  
**Land we own and care for.**  
These are public-access natural areas permanently protected by Door County Land Trust. Trails, wildlife habitat, and ecological restoration make these places open and alive.

### 2. Conservation Easements  
**Land privately owned, but permanently protected.**  
We work with willing landowners to place legal agreements that safeguard their land’s natural features forever—no matter who owns it next.

### 3. Partner Transfers  
**Land we’ve helped protect and passed on.**  
Some lands are best cared for by local government, state parks, or other conservation partners. We help secure these lands, then transfer ownership while ensuring permanent protection.

## Our Approach

Land conservation is both science and relationship. We use:

- **Voluntary agreements** and tools that respect landowner autonomy
- **Science-based prioritization** using tools like the Greenprint and ecological fieldwork
- **Community partnerships** to extend reach and respect local knowledge
- **Long-term stewardship** to keep land healthy and open for generations

We don’t work alone. Landowners, volunteers, researchers, donors, and local partners all play a part.

## Why This Matters

Door County holds more rare species and shoreline habitat than any other county in Wisconsin. But its beauty and biodiversity are under constant pressure from development, climate shifts, and fragmentation.

Every protected acre contributes to clean water, climate resilience, biodiversity, and future generations’ right to experience the land.
