# Conservation Easements

**Protect your land. Keep your land.**  
A Conservation Easement is a legal tool that allows you to permanently protect your land — while still owning and using it.

## What is a Conservation Easement?

A conservation easement (CE) is a voluntary, permanent agreement between a landowner and a land trust, like Door County Land Trust. It limits future development on your land to preserve its natural, scenic, or agricultural values — while allowing you to retain ownership, live on the land, and even pass it down to heirs.

**You still own your land.**  
You decide what uses continue. DCLT is responsible for upholding the terms of the agreement in perpetuity.

## Why Landowners Choose a CE

- Leave a legacy of conservation
- Maintain family ownership
- Protect habitat, farmland, or scenic character
- Avoid unwanted future subdivision or sale
- Potential federal income tax deduction
- Possible reduction in property taxes

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I still live on or use my land?**  
Yes. Each easement is custom-written to reflect your goals.

**Q: Can I still hunt on the land?**  
Yes. Hunting rights remain with you, unless otherwise stated.

**Q: Is the land open to the public?**  
No. Conservation Easements do not create public access.

**Q: Will this affect my taxes?**  
Possibly. The donation may qualify for a federal income tax deduction, and your property taxes may change. Please consult your tax advisor.

## What’s Protected?

Every easement is different, but most protect:
- Forests, wetlands, or open space
- Shorelines or wildlife habitat
- Farmland or scenic vistas

Some easements include "building envelopes" for future use — defined zones where buildings may be allowed.
