## Why Volunteer with DCLT?

Conservation isn't something that happens behind closed doors. It happens in the field—pulling garlic mustard from forest floors, building boardwalks over fragile wetlands, counting nesting birds at dawn.

When you volunteer with Door County Land Trust, you become part of something tangible. You'll see the land change under your hands. You'll learn the names of plants you've walked past for years. And you'll work alongside neighbors who care about the same places you do.

No special skills required. Just a willingness to show up.

## What to Expect

**Your first workday is easy.** Show up at the preserve (directions provided), sign in, and we'll match you with a task that fits your comfort level. Tools, gloves, and water are provided. Wear clothes that can get dirty.

**No long-term commitment required.** Come once or come every month—whatever works for your life. We're grateful for any time you can give.

**You'll learn something.** Our staff and experienced volunteers love sharing knowledge. Expect to leave knowing more about native plants, restoration ecology, or Door County's natural history.

**All ages welcome.** Many workdays are family-friendly. Youth under 16 should be accompanied by an adult. Some tasks (like chainsaw work) require training and are adults-only.
