## Future Recommendation

Migrate to a **dynamic publication archive**, with metadata for each item:

- `title`
- `date`
- `issue_type` (newsletter, report, misc.)
- `topics` or tags
- `download_url`
- `thumbnail_url`

Enable filtering or sorting by date, topic, or publication type in the new system. Consider integrating with a CMS collection or custom post type in WordPress for easier maintenance.
