<span style="font-family: 'quattrocento sans'; font-size: 14pt;"><a href="https://www.doorcountylandtrust.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Chambers-Island-Hardwood-forest-3.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-5067 " src="https://www.doorcountylandtrust.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Chambers-Island-Hardwood-forest-3-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="293" height="376" /></a></span>

<span style="font-family: 'quattrocento sans';">We are pleased to announce that Thursday, December 13, the Door County Land Trust completed two more land acquisitions on Chambers Island!  These two additional projects are the third and fourth of five planned land protection projects on the island this December! The two properties, one a 10-acre hardwood and hemlock forest and the other a 40-acre mixed hardwood forest, expand the Door County Land Trust’s 600-acre Chambers Island Nature Preserve. Chambers Island is recognized by Door County conservation partners as a high priority wildlife habitat primarily because of the number of species of birds which migrate and nest on the island, as well as its unique forests and wetlands.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'quattrocento sans';">“After their long, 2,000-mile journey, migrating neo-tropical birds need a safe place to rest and forage for food—and Chambers Island is a beacon in the middle of Green Bay,” shares Door County Land Trust’s Stewardship and Acquisition Specialist Jesse Koyen. “Protecting the island’s plant and forest communities are essential for numerous bird species—171 documented species on Chambers Island so far!”</span>

<span style="font-family: 'quattrocento sans';">The two properties were purchased by the Land Trust with funding from the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, a grant from the John C. Bock Foundation, contributions from Chambers Island landowners, individual donors and Land Trust members. Door County Land Trust continues fundraising efforts to meet a $350,000 goal for the completion of the Chambers Island Nature Preserve including additional land protection, long-term care of the property, interpretive signs and the removal of invasive species.</span>
