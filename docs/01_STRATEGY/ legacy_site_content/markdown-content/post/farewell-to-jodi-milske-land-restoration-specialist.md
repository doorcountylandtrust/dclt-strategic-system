<span style="font-family: 'quattrocento sans'; font-size: 14pt;"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3842" src="https://www.doorcountylandtrust.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Jody-300x263.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="263" />After 15 years with the Land Trust, serving as Land Restoration Specialist, growing and developing the land stewardship program, Jodi Milske is retiring. Jodi's grant-writing and restoration vision has ensured that vital areas of wildlife habitat have been restored to health, that areas of endangered and threatened plants have been monitored and researched, and that the Land Trust's network of conservation partnerships have remained strong. Jodi will continue to share her expertise of local flora by working with Door Landscape and Nursery. Thank you for contributing to the health of this beautiful county.</span>
