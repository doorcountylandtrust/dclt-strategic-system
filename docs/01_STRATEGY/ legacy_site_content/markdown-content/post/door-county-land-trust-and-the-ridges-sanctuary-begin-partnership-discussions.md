<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Door County Land Trust and The Ridges Sanctuary Begin Partnership Discussions</strong></h2>
<div><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">The Door County Land Trust and The Ridges Sanctuary are pleased to announce they have entered into discussions surrounding the combination of the two organizations into one operating entity. The combined organization would build on the strengths of both groups to become a stronger community resource focused on education and research, and the preservation of Door County’s exceptional lands and waters. The parties have worked together extensively in the past on numerous projects, such as the Festival of Nature and have deep respect for one another’s missions, programs, history, identities, employees, and volunteers. These discussions are preliminary and exploratory at this time, with much additional work to be done. The parties will proceed to a final agreement only if they both believe a combination would be in the best interests of their respective members and the community and that one organization could better achieve the combined missions than two organizations continuing separately.</span></div>
