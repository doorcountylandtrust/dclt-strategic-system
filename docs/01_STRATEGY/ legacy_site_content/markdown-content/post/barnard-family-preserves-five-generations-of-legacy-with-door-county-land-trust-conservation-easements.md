<strong>DOOR COUNTY, WI</strong> —The Door County Land Trust is celebrating a milestone conservation effort that will preserve a piece of local history for years to come. The Barnard brothers, William and Carl, have taken a powerful step to protect their family's cherished 120-acre property—a legacy that has been in their family for nearly 150 years.

Carl recalled his mother saying, "Our family has our blood in this farm.” He explained, "This land represents five generations of care and dedication. By working with the Door County Land Trust, we are ensuring that this land will remain protected for farming and as a haven for wildlife, untouched by future development."

<strong>A Legacy of Farming and Stewardship</strong>

The Barnard family’s history is deeply intertwined with the agricultural heritage of Door County. During the early 20th century, their orchard contributed to Door County’s reputation as “Cherryland,” a hub for tart cherry production. Over the decades, the family has adapted their farming practices while remaining committed to preserving the ecological integrity of the land.

The Barnard family’s deep connection to the land is what sparked their interest in approaching the Door County Land Trust to protect two of their properties. “When you have a generational connection to the land, it becomes a part of who you are, a part of your soul,” Carl said. “Land is not just a commodity.”

The conservation easements will allow the Barnards to continue traditional uses of their property, including farming and forestry, while ensuring the land remains protected from development. Carl Barnard reflected, "We’re hoping that this is a model for hundreds of other farms and families to protect land in the area too."

<strong>A Milestone for the Door County Land Trust</strong>

For the Door County Land Trust, 2024 is shaping up to be a banner year. With 18 land protection projects already completed, including this one, the organization is on track to set new records that will surpass 10,000 acres protected by early next year.

“These working lands conservation easements demonstrate that farming and conservation can go hand in hand,” said Emily Wood, Executive Director of Door County Land Trust. “By preserving the Barnard family’s land, we are protecting both the cultural history and ecological health of Door County. This success is a testament to the incredible support we receive from our members and the dedication of landowners like the Barnards.”

Drew Reinke, Conservation Easement Program Manager at DCLT, added, "Orchards are such a large part of Door County's history that it only makes sense that the Land Trust would accept a conservation easement on the Barnard Family Orchards property to protect the scenic and open space values for the public to enjoy!" (<em>Note:  The parcels enrolled in the conservation easements are not open for public access/use without prior permission from the landowners).</em>

The Barnard Family Orchard, an 80-acre property, is a special mix of agricultural plots, small timber stands, and historic structures. What makes it even more valuable? Its scenic views and forests play a role in protecting water quality and maintaining an important wildlife corridor. The working forest conservation easement, a second property of 40 acres, preserves a mature northern mesic forest that provides critical bird habitat, water resource conservation, and ecological corridor protection.

<strong>A Collaborative Effort</strong>

The conservation project was made possible through a cost-sharing agreement with the Barnard family and generous support from DCLT members. Rebecca Barnard, daughter and niece of the property owners, spearheaded the family’s efforts to ensure the easements were finalized in a timely manner and allowed for a balance of active management and conservation activities, thereby providing flexibility for future owners to continue to enjoy and use the property while achieving holistic economic, social and environmental outcomes for the good of the land and future generations. Rebecca’s adjoining 18-acre property, which includes part of the Niagara Escarpment, will also be protected through a future conservation easement donation.

<strong>Looking to the Future</strong>

The Barnard family’s commitment aligns with DCLT’s mission to protect Door County’s natural landscapes while supporting sustainable land use. As development pressures increase, conservation easements like these serve as critical tools to balance growth with environmental stewardship.

“Preserving working lands ensures that the cultural and natural heritage of Door County endures for generations to come,” said Drew Reinke, Conservation Easement Program Manager at DCLT. “This partnership with the Barnard family demonstrates how conservation can support traditional land uses while protecting critical habitats and water quality.”
