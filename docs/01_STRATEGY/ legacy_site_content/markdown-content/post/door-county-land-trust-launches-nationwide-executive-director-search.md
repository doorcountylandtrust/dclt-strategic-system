<span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Door County Land Trust Launches Nationwide Executive Director Search</strong></span></span></p>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong> Sturgeon Bay, WI (March 7, 2022)</strong> – The Door County Land Trust has launched a nationwide search for a new Executive Director, following the announcement in January that current Executive Director Tom Clay is stepping down from the role effective March 11, 2022. The search will be conducted by Kittleman &amp; Associates, a firm that specializes in the recruitment of Executive Directors for the nonprofit sector, including professional associations, foundations, and education, environmental and advocacy organizations. </span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">“Tom has been a dedicated executive director who has successfully led the Land Trust in its work to preserve the uniquely beautiful natural resources of the Door Peninsula,” said Donna Hake, President of the Board. “With lots of work to be done, we look forward to recruiting a new leader who will move an already great organization to the next level.”</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">The search will be overseen by a Search Committee appointed by the Board of Directors.
