With the recent addition of three land projects, DCLT now protects more than 9,400 acres across Door County and its surrounding islands. The three projects are an addition to the Hibbard Creek Natural Area, the creation of the new Oak Bluff Natural Area, and a new conservation easement. Collectively, the properties hold victories for water quality, birds, and wildlife.

&nbsp;

“Community support for these conservation projects that span from north to south has been key to increasing the pace of land protection efforts,” said Executive Director Emily Wood. "As stewards of the land, it is our duty to safeguard the delicate balance of nature. Preserving these habitats is not just a win for wildlife; it is an investment in the future, ensuring that generations to come can witness the beauty and biodiversity that thrives when a place is protected forever."

&nbsp;

Located west of Kangaroo Lake, the Land Trust’s Hibbard Creek Natural Area is expanded with a 77-acre addition of wetland and cedar forest. In extending the natural area’s acreage, an important corridor that permits the movement of wildlife across the peninsula is now permanently preserved. Movement across the landscape is crucial to the survival of wildlife as it allows them to find food, breed, and establish new home territories.

&nbsp;

The Hibbard Creek watershed contains feeder streams, bordering wetlands, and woodlands that follow the creek and filter surface water on its way into Lake Michigan. Its impact on water quality is further heightened because Hibbard Creek is the longest stream that traverses the peninsula. At this time, there are no plans to develop trails at Hibbard Creek Natural Area.

&nbsp;

The Land Trust’s recent purchase of 119 acres just west of Brussels is now known as Oak Bluff Natural Area. Overlooking the waters of Green Bay, the property includes a mature red and white oak forest at the top of the Niagara Escarpment; 1,700 feet of undeveloped 150-feet-tall bluff edge provides migratory bird habitat, and grasslands that will be replanted in the coming years with native shrubs and pollinator-friendly perennials. A short loop trail is planned for the future that will offer visitors a blufftop view of Green Bay.

&nbsp;

A new conservation easement along County Road A, between Fish Creek and Ephraim, now protects 40 acres on a forested parcel belonging to Doris Thompson. The property bridges important wildlife habitats between Peninsula State Park and the Gibraltar Ephraim Swamp Natural Area. Thompson entered into a conservation easement agreement with the Land Trust to protect her property from future subdivision or development, ensuring it continues to sustain bird and wildlife habitats.
