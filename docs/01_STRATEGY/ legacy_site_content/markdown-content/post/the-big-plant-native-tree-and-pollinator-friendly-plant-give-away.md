<span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>
Sturgeon Bay, WI</strong> – Door County Land Trust will give away 1,000 native tree and plant seedlings over the next month.  The trees and plants are free and will be available at scheduled locations from Sister Bay to Southern Door over the next four weekends. Each give-away day will be held from 9am to noon. Saturday, April 24 will be held at the Stabbur Beer Garden adjacent to Al Johnson’s; Saturday, May 1 at the Main Street Market in Egg Harbor, Saturday, May 8 at the Southern Door School parking lot; and Saturday, May 15 at Door County Land Trust’s office, 23 N Fifth Ave, Sturgeon Bay. A limit of 3 items per household is requested. New members may join the Land Trust by making a donation of any amount on these days and receive a new member packet and Nature Notes calendar at the event.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">The native tree and plant give-away is a part of The Big Plant coordinated by the Climate Change Coalition of Door County. Through organizations partnering on The Big Plant, more than 5,000 trees will be planted.  Door County Land Trust chose to include pollinator-friendly perennial plants in their give-away so those with small properties or apartments would also be able to participate.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">“Whether you have a planter on a porch, a small backyard or several acres, you can plant something that helps native insects, birds and wildlife,” says Door County Land Trust director of charitable giving Cinnamon Rossman. “As these trees grow and flowers bloom, they’ll be a reminder of the things we can do to preserve and improve our environment.”</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">The selection of trees includes American Arborvitae (Northern White Cedar), Red Pine, White Pine, White Spruce, and Balsam Fir locally raised at Evergreen Nursery in Sturgeon Bay. The selection of perennial plants includes Swamp Milkweed (<em>Asclepias incarnata</em>), Monkey Flower (<em>Mimulus ringens</em>), </span><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Beardtongue (</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><em>Penstemon Digitalis</em>), and Yellow Coneflower (<em>Ratibida pinnata</em>). Each of these plants and trees is hardy in Door County and is beneficial to insects, birds and wildlife. The trees and plants are not potted and need to be planted the day they are picked up.</span>
