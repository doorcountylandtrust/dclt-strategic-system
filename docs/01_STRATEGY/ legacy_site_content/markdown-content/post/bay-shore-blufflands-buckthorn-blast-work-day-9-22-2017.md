<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What is the Bay Shore Blufflands Buckthorn Blast?</strong></span> The Door County Land Trust, in partnership with Bay Shore Property Owners Association, is beginning a multi-year restoration and buckthorn eradication effort on the Bay Shore Blufflands Nature Preserve. This community conservation project will bring neighbors and community together to achieve a common goal, awareness and eradication of buckthorn (among other invasive species).

Funding for this project is provided by the Bay Shore Property Owners Association and Door County Land Trust with a Land Trust Excellence &amp; Advancement Partnership (LEAP) grant from the Land Trust Alliance and Gathering Waters.
