Door County birds by Naseem Reza, Melody Walsh, John Van Den Brandt and others.

This year marks the 100th anniversary of the passage of the International Migratory Bird Treaty Act. To recognize that landmark legislation, National Geographic, BirdLife International and the Cornell Lab of Ornithology declared 2018 as the "Year of the Bird."

As we carry out the mission of Door County Land Trust we are reminded of a startling reality – invasive species are the main driver behind bird species extinctions and the same goes for those species that are presently clinging to existence. In response, our effort to protect and restore native habitats has never been more intense nor has it been more critical. Thanks to supporters like you, we are making a difference for hundreds of bird species.

During this summer season we strive to maintain trails, stay ahead of invasive species on our nature preserves, and inspire the community through our hikes and wild adventures. And we invite you along on this grand journey!

Yours in conservation,
