The Door County Land Trust and Write On, Door County invite you to tell a story at “Wild Words: Celebrate the Waters of Door County” an event to take place on Thursday, April 26, from 7:00-9:00 pm at Crossroads at Big Creek, Sturgeon Bay.

Storytellers are asked to use twenty pictures and twenty seconds per picture. The format, called “pecha kucha,” is Japanese for chit-chat and gives each storyteller 6 minutes and 40 seconds to interpret the water in any way they wish. The Door County Land Trust coordinates the technical aspects so storytellers need only worry about their picture and their stories.

The event, “Wild Words: Celebrate the Waters of Door County” April 26, 7:00-9:00 pm at Crossroads at Big Creek, will be free and open to the public.
