If you have ever considered hosting or helping at a Dining for Open Spaces event, we need your help this year! Members like you are at the heart of the Dining series . Proceeds from the member-hosted events in the Dining for Open Spaces series have raised more than $330,000 to date.

What does hosting or co-hosting an event entail? We'll guide you through the process, which may be as simple as hosting a brunch, lunch or dinner for a small group or helping at an event that is already planned.
