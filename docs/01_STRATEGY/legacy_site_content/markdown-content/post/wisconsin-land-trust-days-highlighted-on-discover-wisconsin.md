<span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Madison, WI</strong> – June 02, 2020 – Discover Wisconsin, the state’s leading media brand and tourism TV show, will shine the spotlight on Wisconsin Land Trust Days in an upcoming episode. The episode premieres Saturday, June 13, 2020, at 6:30 PM on WFRV Channel 5 (CBS), Green Bay. The episode is available for online streaming at discoverwisconsin.com, Roku, Apple TV, SmartTV, Google Chromecast and Amazon Fire.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">This episode of Discover Wisconsin calls attention to Wisconsin Land Trust Days, a series of fun, outdoor events hosted by land trusts each year during August and September.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">“Wisconsin Land Trust Days events give us the opportunity to introduce people to the work land trusts are doing in their communities,” said Mike Carlson, executive director of Gathering Waters: Wisconsin’s Alliance for Land Trusts. “Land trusts are nonprofit organizations that work to protect land in perpetuity—ensuring Wisconsin’s natural resources, habitat, farmland, working forests, scenic areas, prairies and other special places are available for future generations. Our job as an alliance is to give land trusts the tools they need to remain strong and sustainable so they can protect Wisconsin’s land, water, wildlife and way of life.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">“This year, Wisconsin Land Trust Days may look different due to the COVID-19 pandemic,” Carlson noted. “But we still hope people will discover and explore the beautiful natural places that are open to the public in their communities.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">“At past Land Trust Days events, we’ve often heard people say, ‘I never knew this place was here,’” Carlson said. “These hidden gems are all over Wisconsin. People can visit and explore these special places for free—because a nearby land trust protected them.”</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">The half-hour show kicks off with the first Wisconsin Land Trust Days event at Villa St. Joseph near La Crosse, where Carol Abrahamzon, executive director of Mississippi Valley Conservancy, shares the organization’s mission to conserve both native habitats and farmlands in Wisconsin’s Driftless area. During the Hiking, Growing, Gazing event, the public toured the gardens, took in a sunset hike to a beautiful scenic bluff overlook and gazed at the stars with the La Crosse Area Astronomical Society.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">The next event takes host Mariah Haberman to the Yawkey Forest Reserve for the Lake Katherine Paddle Tour hosted by the Northwoods Land Trust in Hazelhurst, Wisconsin. The Yawkey Forest Reserve is one of the largest donations of shoreline to a Wisconsin land trust. According to Northwoods executive director, Ted Anchor, the reserve consists of over 430 acres and protects 4.4 miles of Lake Katherine shoreline. The Yawkey Forest Reserve creates a unique habitat for wildlife and gives people a beautiful place to enjoy.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">“Our Wisconsin Land Trust Days episode is one of the most enlightening shows I’ve had the honor of being a part of,” said Haberman. “We hope to help demystify the topic of land trusts through this episode and inspire travelers to relish the quiet serenity you’re sure to find on the beautiful public lands owned and managed by Wisconsin’s land trusts.”</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">The Discover Wisconsin crew also made their way to the annual Ride to the Barns event hosted by Tall Pines Conservancy in Waukesha County. “Tall Pines Conservancy’s mission is to preserve our rural heritage by protecting farmland, water resources and natural areas,” said Susan Buchanan, executive director of Tall Pines Conservancy. “We strive to sustain the unique character of Wisconsin’s environment for future generations.” The segment also highlights the owners of Serenity and Koepke Farms.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Rounding out the episode, Haberman heads to the Fungus Among Us event hosted by the Door County Land Trust at the Kangaroo Lake Nature Preserve in Baileys Harbor, Wisconsin. Wild mushroom expert Charlotte Lukes shares her passion for conservation and fungi. Haberman takes part in a fungus-and-mushroom hike and learns about the importance of wetland conservation from Cinnamon Rossman, director of charitable giving at Door County Land Trust.</span>
