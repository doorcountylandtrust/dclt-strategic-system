Spring is an exciting time in Door County. After a long winter, pops of green begin to appear in the landscape. Birds return too, bringing along their birdsong to cheer us up. The lake ice has disappeared, opening to views of vast blueness. The community shakes off the restful energy of the “quiet season” and gathers outdoors as the weather permits. With this comes many opportunities to join in the festivity of spring, and the celebration of our home, the Earth! The holiday that we celebrate every day – Earth Day – is coming up on April 22, 2025.

<strong>We compiled a list of FREE events surrounding this special time of year for you to participate in, most held locally in Door County, and some online! We can’t wait to see you at these events and out on the trails! Happy Spring!</strong>
