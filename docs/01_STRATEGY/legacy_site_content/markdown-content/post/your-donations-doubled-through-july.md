<strong>Your Support of Door County Land Trust Doubled, Thanks to Matching Gift
</strong>

A Matching Gift Challenge has been launched for the Door County Land Trust’s 2025 Conservation and Stewardship Campaign to support the completion of a remarkable 15 land protection projects this year.

Through July, Mary Prindiville, long-time friend and member of the Land Trust, will match each donation dollar for dollar to help preserve the future of beautiful, wild Door County.

“‘A connection with the natural world, the opportunity to walk barefoot in the grass, to plant seeds in the soil, to hear birdsong, or touch the bark of an ancient oak should be a fundamental human right.’ I believe that,” Mary says, quoting Lucy Jones’s <em>Losing Eden: Our Fundamental Need for the Natural World and Its ability to Heal Body and Soul.</em>

Prindiville’s roots to Door County’s wild places began in college and deepened each time she’d come to visit. By 2017, she was frequenting the many Land Trust Preserves and became an integral part of Door County’s thriving conservation and arts family.

She says, “This is the land that has attracted artists, musicians, and theatre groups. Door County Land Trust…protects the wild spaces that draw creative people here. This is the land that calls out for protection now... I am so impressed by the vision DCLT has—their plans to hedge against development, the care for wild habitats, for rare plants, for birds, and animals. DCLT works to keep water clean and maintain trails... <strong>The work of this non-profit is overwhelming to me, and I invite you to share in the responsibility for the land we have here</strong>.”

Door County Land Trust protects land from Washington Island to the southern county line. With your help, another 500 acres can be protected this year. Donations to the 2025 Conservation and Stewardship Campaign directly support land protection efforts to protect the best of Door County’s wilderness, wetlands, scenic views, and wildlife areas.

Donations also provide for stewardship and care of land that keeps wilderness areas thriving. Loss of habitat is the single greatest threat to many animals, birds, insects, plants, and other species. Community support is needed to help defend and restore native habitats such as prairie grasslands where birds nest, to plant trees and connect fragmented forest corridors, to fend off invasions of non-native species that threaten sensitive lands, and to protect wetlands that keep Door County’s water clean. And this work is more important than ever.

“We are entering a period of profound challenge — where the tools we’ve long relied on to do our good work are suddenly vanishing. Knowles-Nelson Stewardship program funds are being slashed. Federal conservation funding has all but evaporated. And yet, the urgency of our work has never been greater,” says Emily Wood, Executive Director of the Door County Land Trust.

Prindiville protects wild lands to ensure all of us have the opportunity to be moved by them the way she has been. She says, “Words of Aldo Leopold remind me both of the responsibility and the joy that come along with protecting the land that surrounds us. It brings out the artist and the hiker in us. It heals our bodies and our souls.”

When donors make a gift to the 2025 Conservation and Stewardship Campaign, Prindiville will generously match donations dollar for dollar up to $25,000.

Prindiville’s story is one of curiosity, connection, conservation, and championing the challenge for our community to join her in supporting DCLT’s efforts to keep Door County’s wild lands untamed.
