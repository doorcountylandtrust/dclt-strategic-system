- Connect storytelling outcomes to measurable behaviors and system performance

### **📌 Priority Dashboards to Build**

| **Dashboard** | **Primary Users** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Engagement Funnel** | Comms, Dev | Visualize how users move from visitor → subscriber → donor → advocate |
| **Donor Retention + Upgrade** | Dev, ED | Monitor recurring giving, second gift rates, lapsed/reactivation trends |
| **Campaign Performance** | Comms, Dev | Track appeal/email/website campaign KPIs (opens, clicks, gifts, avg gift) |
| **Landowner Outreach** | Conservation, Dev | Track landowner engagement, inquiry → easement pipeline |
| **Event Metrics** | Outreach, Comms | Measure RSVPs, turnout, follow-up response by type/region |
| **Survey Response + Tagging** | All | Analyze survey participation, sentiment, and persona mapping |

### **🛠️ Tools & Sources**

- **Salesforce Reports** – Primary engine for internal CRM reporting
- **GA4 / Plausible** – Web engagement data (CTAs, event pages, donation funnel)
- **Formstack / SurveyMonkey** – Optional survey dashboards or raw exports
- **Campaign Monitor / Constant Contact** – Email metrics for cross-channel view
- **Airtable (Phase 1)** – Lightweight data tracking for emerging comms needs

### **🔍 Metrics We Care About**

- Donor metrics: total gifts, gift size, time to second gift, retention, recurring upgrades
- Messaging: click-throughs, engagement rates, content preference (via UTMs or tags)
- Website CTAs: conversions by persona/story/segment
- Campaign response: uplift by audience cluster, regional or psychographic
- Landowner pipeline: inquiries, lead sources, % moving to active discussions
- Events: registration rates, no-show %, follow-up conversions

### **🧩 Integration Needs**

- Consistent tagging across channels (e.g., Campaign ID, Segment, Persona)
- Web CTA → CRM connection (e.g., UTMs stored on Contact record)
- Story overlay system integration (future phase)
- Define success benchmarks for key journeys

### **📈 Outcomes & Usage**

- Monthly or quarterly team reviews
- Strategy refinement using actual behavior trends
- Data-backed storytelling insights
- Donor and stakeholder transparency

### **🧱 Phase Plan**

| **Phase** | **Timeframe** | **Goals** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Phase 1 – Foundations** | Jul–Sep 2025 | Define KPIs, audit existing reports, mock key dashboards |
| **Phase 2 – Internal Rollout** | Oct–Dec 2025 | Build and launch core dashboards, train teams |
| **Phase 3 – Advanced Views** | 2026 | Persona-based dashboards, story overlay merge, exec summary panels |
