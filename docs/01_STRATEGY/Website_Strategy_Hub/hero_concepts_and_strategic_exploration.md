# Hero Concepts and Strategic Exploration

This document outlines creative concepts for the Door County Land Trust website hero section. Each concept is grounded in the organization's mission and values, with a focus on emotional resonance, engagement, and storytelling. The goal is to explore innovative formats that go beyond common trends while staying aligned with donor psychology, land protection goals, and DCLT's long-term brand system.

---

## Strategic Purpose of the Hero Section

- Evoke reverence and emotional connection to the land
- Create a sense of place, belonging, and legacy
- Frame the visitor as a protector or steward
- Set the tone for the rest of the site (serene, serious, elevated)
- Invite action without pressure

## Trends to Be Careful About

| Trend              | Pros                    | Risks                                                      |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Video background   | Immersive, eye-catching | Can feel commercial or stock-like; performance issues      |
| Scroll parallax    | Visual interest         | Can feel gimmicky or dated; alignment bugs                 |
| SPAs / Long scroll | Narrative potential     | Hard to navigate; not mobile-friendly unless well-executed |
| Hover-based motion | Quick feedback          | Not accessible or meaningful                               |

##  Innovative Concepts for the Hero Area

### 1. **Hero That Breathes**
A visual design where elements expand and contract slowly, mimicking breath.
- Text pulses gently
- Background subtly brightens/darkens
- Nature has a pulse

**Goal:** Convey that protected land is alive, and the visitor has a role in keeping it that way

---

### 2. **Whisper from the Land**
A quote or phrase fades in from the land's point of view.
- Example: “I was once slated for condos. Now wild orchids bloom here.”
- Leads into: “This is what your gift makes possible.”

**Goal:** Emotional storytelling + personification = intimacy and purpose

---

### 3. **Legacy Clock / TimeLayer Hero**
An interactive before/after/future visual that shows how the land has changed and will change.
- 3-frame slider or parallax scene
- Real data from land files (acquisition year, restoration year, future goals)

**Goal:** Reinforce long-term impact and legacy giving

---

### 4. **Silent Hero**
A stark, still, intentional hero section with no motion
- Just text + still image or background color
- Bold serif headline
- Example: “We protect what makes this place unforgettable.”

**Goal:** Stand out through calmness and conviction. Anti-gimmick.

---

### 5. **Live Nature Feed**
Use real-time data from preserves
- Weather, season, bloom, migration updates
- “Right now at Bay Shore Blufflands: 68°F, goldenrod blooming.”

**Goal:** Connection to real-time place, localism, relevance

---

### 6. **Scroll-Driven Illustrated Storyboard**
One long visual experience with illustration and animation
- Each scroll step shows a new layer of the story
- Map reveals, field note snippets, wildlife sightings
- Could combine photos, illustrations, and animated infographics

**Goal:** Build immersion like a storybook or natural history game

**Note:** High effort. Possible MVP route: break into modular sections with progressive enhancement.

---

## 💡 Strategy for Testing / Rotation
- Treat each concept as a modular hero block
- Build MVPs to test emotional resonance, scroll behavior, and donor reaction
- Rotate periodically or use A/B testing
- Align timing with campaigns (e.g. Legacy Hero for planned giving season)

---

## 📈 Communication Notes
- Prepare internal slide deck showing 2–3 top concepts
- Pair each concept with:
  - The emotional goal
  - An example visual or wireframe
  - Tech/design cost estimate (low, med, high)
  - Sample CTA it would support

---

## ✨ Closing Thought
> "If the web is full of motion and stimulation, what would it feel like if our homepage invited stillness?"

This document is a living exploration. As the brand and team evolve, so can these ideas.
