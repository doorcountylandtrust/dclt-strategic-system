# —— Stewardship Field Coordinator

*June 2025 | Website & Communications Input*

---

### **✅ What’s Working**

- **Preserve Explorer Map:** Appreciates the current map view and toggle functionality.
- **Preserves as Visitor Destination:** Primary reason to visit the site is to explore preserves.

---

### **❌ What’s Not Working / Needs Improvement**

- **Broken Link: Green Print Map** (a legacy resource showing high biodiversity convergence)
- **Lack of context for Natural Areas:** No explanation of why some places aren’t promoted—could mislead or confuse public.
- **Trash and trail etiquette issues:** Especially dog waste—needs clearer expectations set.

---

### **💡 Website Suggestions & Opportunities**

### **🗺 Interactive & Visual Enhancements**

- More **interactive map elements** on the homepage (Preserve Finder, ecological overlays)
- Consider integrating **ecological corridors** or habitat sensitivity into map layer
- Use drone videos, walkthroughs, **immersive photography** to bring preserves to life
- Highlight **endangered/threatened species**—suggested as a standalone or embedded block with interactive info (though not geolocatable)

### **🌿 Elevate Stewardship Visibility**

- Create a **“What is Stewardship?”** education block/page
    - Showcase: trail restoration, rare plant monitoring, invasive removal
    - Highlight long-term and “coming soon” efforts—not just completed work
- Add articles or updates on active land care to **connect values with action**

### **🧠 Values & Principles**

- Homepage should reflect **land ethic and stewardship principles**
- Consider concise language on:
    - “Leave it better than you found it”
    - Respect for land, species, and ecosystems

### **🤝 Cultural Acknowledgement**

- More visible **recognition of Indigenous nations** connected to the land
- <!-- BROKEN LINK: [https://ridgessanctuary.org/indigenous-heritage/](https://ridgessanctuary.org/indigenous-heritage/) -->
- Include land acknowledgements where appropriate

### **♿ Accessibility & Inclusion**

- Support **translation tools** on site (e.g., Spanish, Hmong)
- Add **accessibility plugin** for visitors with disabilities
