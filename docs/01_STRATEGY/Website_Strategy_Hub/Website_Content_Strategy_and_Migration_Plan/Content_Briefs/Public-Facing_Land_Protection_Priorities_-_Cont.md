# —— Public-Facing Land Protection Priorities – Content Ideas

### **🔥 Goal**

Create digestible, inspiring, and action-oriented content based on the 2024–2028 Land Priority Plan, for use on the website and in campaigns—**without disclosing sensitive data**.

---

### **🧱 Potential Content Structure**

**1. Hero Intro Section**

- Short, emotional hook: *“Why Door County’s nature needs us now”*
- Overview map of project areas (general zones, not parcels)

**2. Key Focus Areas (Modular Blocks)**

- Forests
- Wetlands & Water
- Escarpment & Geology
- Migratory Birds
- Rare Species

**3. How It Works**

- Methods: Fee acquisition, easements, partnerships
- Why proactive planning matters
- Emphasis on science-based approach

**4. Your Role**

- Donate / Volunteer / Visit
- “Adopt an Acre” concept
- Stories of impact

---

### **🧩 Visual / Interactive Ideas**

- Scrollable story map or infographic
- Hoverable “Conservation Zones” map
- Before/after impact sliders
- Seasonal migration animations

---

### **🔐 Content Sensitivity Guidelines**

- Avoid parcel-level maps or naming unprotected parcels
- Use illustrations or generalized zones
- OK to highlight **public preserves** and **completed successes**

---

## **🔧 Core Goals for Public Version**

1. **Educate** without overwhelming
2. **Inspire** a sense of awe and urgency
3. **Engage** audiences to act (visit, volunteer)
4. **Protect** sensitive data (e.g. landowner status, acquisition plans)

---

## **🖥️ Suggested Web Section: “Where We Work” or “Our Conservation Focus”**

---

### **🌍 Intro:**

### **“Why Here? Why Now?”**

**Headline:**

*Saving What Makes Door County Exceptional*

**Subhead (Story-Driven):**

> Door County is one of the most ecologically rich places in the Midwest. From ancient cliffs to rare orchids, its natural diversity is unlike anywhere else—and it’s under threat. Here’s how we’re protecting it, forever.
> 

---

### **🧭 Priority Areas Overview**

Use a **general map** showing regions, not parcels. Group ~5–7 zones:

- Niagara Escarpment
- Coastal Wetlands
- Interior Forests
- Migratory Bird Corridors
- Rare Species Habitats

💡 *Consider* iconography, banners, or a visual “storybook” scroll layout

---

### **🌿 What We’re Protecting (Modular Cards)**

Each card includes:

- 📸 Visual (photo or illustration)
- ✍️ 1–2 paragraph explainer
- 🔗 Optional “Learn More” link

**Themes to highlight:**

- **Water & Wetlands:** “Natural filters and vital habitats.”
- **Forests:** “Where birds nest and trees clean the air.”
- **Rare Species:** “Guarding the unique life forms of the peninsula.”
- **Fish & Shorelines:** “Healthy creeks mean healthy lakes—and better fish fries.”
- **Bird Migration Pathways:** “Why thousands of birds rely on Door County to rest and refuel.”

---

### **📈 Optional Data Snapshot (Engaging, Not Overwhelming)**

- Acres protected
- Number of preserves
- Species benefiting (icon grid)
- “Since 1986…” timeline

---

### **🫱 How People Can Help**

- ✅ *Donate to protect more land*
- 🥾 *Visit a preserve*
- 🙋‍♀️ *Become a conservation volunteer*
- 🌾 *Adopt an acre / Sponsor a species*

---

## **🧷 What Not to Share Publicly**

- ❌ Parcel boundaries
- ❌ Landowner identities or pending acquisitions
- ❌ “Coming soon” sites unless already secured
- ✅ Safe to show general ecological zones and completed projects

---

## **🧰 Optional Add-Ons (Phase 2)**

- Interactive GIS Light (public lands only)
- Seasonal Highlights: “Where birds are now”
- Story Series: Stewards, donors, and scientists
