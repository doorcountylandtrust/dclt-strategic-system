# Strategic Brief: “How We Save Land” Section

## Purpose
To explain what land protection means, how DCLT does it, and why it matters — while guiding each audience toward the right level of involvement. This is a foundational explainer section that establishes DCLT’s credibility, mission alignment, and long-term impact.

## Primary Audiences
- Conservation-minded landowners considering an easement, sale, or donation  
- Curious public and visitors seeking to understand local conservation efforts  
- Volunteers and on-the-ground stewards learning about ecology and balance  
- Local partners and municipal/government collaborators  
- Donors who want to fund visible, lasting impact  
- Press, researchers, and aligned environmental organizations  

## Voice and Tone
- Friendly but grounded  
- Accessible but data-informed  
- Mission-driven but not preachy  
- Locally rooted but professionally credible  
- Actionable, human, and purpose-driven  

## Core CTA Actions (contextual to page)
- Inquire about land protection (easement, sale, donation)  
- Volunteer for stewardship activities  
- Donate to fund land protection and care  
- Explore a preserve or attend a guided hike  
- Learn more via stories, research, or partner links  
- Subscribe or connect for future involvement

# Proposed New Information Architecture

We are moving from a legacy flat structure (long scrolling pages with mixed audiences and mixed purpose) to a tiered structure with focused entry points, modular reuse, and cross-linking.

---

## Top-Level Section: How We Save Land  
This acts as the “What we do” explainer zone — rewritten to be leaner, modular, and better cross-linked with maps, CTAs, and stories.

### 1. Overview: “How We Save Land”
- Hero image and brief summary of DCLT’s land protection approach  
- Three columns or icon blocks: **Preserves**, **Easements**, **Partner Transfers**  
- Visuals: escarpment, forest, shoreline, wildlife, birds  
- CTA: Choose Your Path (volunteer, donate, protect your land)
