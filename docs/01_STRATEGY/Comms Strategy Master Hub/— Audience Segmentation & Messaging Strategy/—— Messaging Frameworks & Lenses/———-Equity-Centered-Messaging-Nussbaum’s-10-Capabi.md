# ——— Equity-Centered Messaging: Nussbaum’s 10 Capabilities

**🧭 Messaging Through a DEI Lens: Nussbaum’s 10 Capabilities**

> This framework applies philosopher Martha Nussbaum’s 10 central human capabilities to Door County Land Trust’s messaging and engagement strategy. It helps ensure that our communications are not only compelling and human-centered, but also equitable, inclusive, and grounded in the idea that access to nature and conservation is a human right—not a luxury.

## 🎯 Alignment with Nussbaum’s Capabilities

By integrating the 10 Capabilities framework, we:

- **Show the human impact** of conservation, making it emotionally resonant.
- **Frame access to nature as a right**, reinforcing its essential role in dignity and quality of life.
- **Empower supporters to take action**, emphasizing agency and inclusion.

## 🔧 Putting the Capabilities to Work: Next Steps for DCLT Communications

To turn this framework into real impact across our communications, here are the next actions we can take:

### 1. **Build a Capabilities Lens into Our Content Calendar**

- Tag content themes (health, play, affiliation, etc.) in our planning calendar.
- Ensure monthly outreach hits a range of capabilities — not just the same few.
- Example: Don’t just lead with “Life” and “Control,” rotate in “Play,” “Other Species,” and “Emotions.”

### 2. **Audit Existing Materials**

- Review our homepage, brochures, emails, and signage.
- Which capabilities are underrepresented?
- Where can we add stories, visuals, or phrasing to align more closely with human dignity and access?

### 3. **Train Our Team in Inclusive Storytelling**

- Host a 1-hour staff workshop or slide deck on:
    - What the 10 Capabilities mean
    - How to identify them in our current content
    - How to write with them in mind

### 4. **Prioritize Equity in Website Access and Language**

- Integrate ADA-friendly language about *bodily integrity* and access.
- Emphasize *control over environment* by making calls to action clear, simple, and empowering.
- Consider a short explainer or blog post introducing the Capabilities framework for transparency.

### 5. **Share This Philosophy with Donors and Partners**

- Use a donor email or event to explain how we’re aligning conservation with human flourishing.
- Frame this shift as a bold, inclusive evolution of our messaging — showing respect for both people and land.
