# :: Change Communication Strategy

*A phased messaging plan to support internal and external understanding, trust, and engagement throughout DCLT’s brand and website evolution.*

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To manage cognitive load, reduce resistance, and build trust through clear, sequenced communication of:

- The **why** behind major changes (brand, website, CRM, messaging)
- The **what** is changing and when
- The **how** stakeholders will be supported through transition

---

## 📌 Guiding Principles

1. **Clarity before persuasion** — We lead with transparency, not spin
2. **Audience-specific pathways** — Different stakeholders need different information and timing
3. **Cumulative reveal, not a big bang** — Trust builds through progressive understanding
4. **Invite participation, not just announcement** — Feedback loops reduce resistance

---

## 🗺️ Stakeholder Map & Info Needs

| Stakeholder | Info Needed | Ideal Tone | Key Timing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Board** | Strategic rationale, risk mitigation, timeline | Confident, accountable | Before public comms |
| **Staff** | Practical implications, voice in process | Reassuring, collaborative | During co-creation |
| **Longtime Members** | Continuity + improvement messaging | Respectful, warm | Pre-launch sneak peeks |
| **New/Younger Supporters** | Values alignment, modern UX | Engaging, visionary | Launch + beyond |
| **Volunteers** | Their role, where their voice shows | Appreciative, affirming | Just before launch |
| **Partners/Funders** | Alignment with mission and capacity | Strategic, high-level | Post-board review |

---

## 🧩 Sequencing Milestones (Phase-Based)

| Phase | Internal Communication | External Communication |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Discovery & Research | Staff/stakeholder check-ins | “We’re listening” blog, social |
| Focus Group Synthesis | Internal share-outs | Optional public insights teaser |
| Brand System Preview | Staff walkthrough → board preview | Key supporter sneak peek |
| Website MVP Testing | Staff testing → focus group test | “Coming soon” teaser (optional) |
| Launch Readiness | Staff onboarding + talking points | Email, social, website rollout |
| Post-Launch Support | Internal feedback loops, fixes | “What’s new & why” microsite section |

---

## 🔁 Feedback Loops

- Anonymous suggestion box (via Form)
- Focus group reconvening post-launch
- Internal comms check-ins (15-min debriefs)
- Email & analytics listening for confusion/drop-offs

---

## 🧠 Emotional Load Acknowledgement

Include this type of language in internal messaging:

> “We know this is a lot of change. It’s okay to feel unsure — we’re moving in phases, and we’ll support each other along the way.”
> 

---

## 💬 Sample Messaging Snippets

**Board:**

> “This isn’t just a design refresh — it’s a strategy to unify mission, modern experience, and donor engagement.”
> 

**Staff:**

> “You don’t have to be the expert on everything. We’ll provide talking points, onboarding, and room to adjust.”
> 

**Longtime Members:**

> “We’re still us — just with clearer tools to protect what you love.”
> 

**Public:**

> “You’ll see some changes soon. Here’s why — and what it means for conservation in Door County.”
>
