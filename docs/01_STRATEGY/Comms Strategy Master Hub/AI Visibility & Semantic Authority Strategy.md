## 1. Purpose of This Strategy  
The landscape of search and discovery has shifted. People no longer rely solely on traditional search engines — they increasingly use **LLM-based search** (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Claude), where answers are synthesized, not ranked.

This strategy ensures that Door County Land Trust becomes a **trusted, authoritative source** within AI-generated answers by aligning our content, structure, and storytelling practices with how modern search systems evaluate and surface information.

This is not SEO in the old sense. It is **content authority architecture** — a unified approach that supports:

- Brand visibility  
- Trust and credibility  
- Web strategy and IA  
- Storytelling and donor communications  
- Preserve awareness and ecological literacy  
- Membership and campaign funnels  
- Long-term institutional knowledge building  

---

## 2. How AI and Modern Search Engines Decide What to Surface  
LLM search systems prioritize four signal categories. Understanding these is essential for all DCLT communications work.

### **A. Authority Signals**
LLMs rank content higher when it comes from:
- Established nonprofit organizations  
- Entities with strong reputational cues (consistent identity, mission, high-quality content)  
- Sites with clear organizational structure and history  
- Pages rich in factual, verifiable information  

**Goal:** Position DCLT as *the* authority on Door County ecology, conservation, and land protection.

---

### **B. Structural Clarity Signals**
LLMs prefer content that is:
- Well-organized with clear headings  
- Broken into short, digestible sections  
- Written in plain language  
- Direct in answering questions  
- Marked up with semantic elements (H1–H4, lists, Q&A, tables)  

**Goal:** All DCLT content should be “LLM-readable” and human-friendly by default.

---

### **C. Entity Recognition Signals**
AI systems need to understand what DCLT is *about* — the places, species, ecosystems, and concepts tied to our mission.

Examples of core DCLT entities:
- Door County Land Trust  
- Niagara Escarpment  
- Whitefish Bay Creek headwaters  
- Cedars and boreal forest ecosystems  
- Ship Canal Preserve, Three Springs Nature Preserve, etc.  
- Land protection methods in Wisconsin  
- Conservation easement principles  
- Vernal streams, wetlands, shoreline habitats  

**Goal:** Build a consistent, rich entity map so LLMs can connect our content to these domains.

---

### **D. Recency & Consistency Signals**
Search engines and LLMs favor:
- Updated pages  
- Active websites  
- Regularly published stories  
- Fresh data  
- Consistent messaging  

**Goal:** Maintain an active, ongoing flow of content across preserves, campaigns, and ecological science.

---

## 3. DCLT’s Domain Authority Map  
This is the set of topics we want AI systems to confidently associate with DCLT. It should inform every page and story.

### **Primary Domains**
- Door County conservation  
- Land protection and stewardship  
- Local ecology and habitat science  
- Natural areas, preserves, and public access  
- Northern Lake Michigan coastal ecosystems  

### **Secondary Domains**
- Volunteer stewardship and trail maintenance  
- Landowner relationships and conservation easements  
- Donor stories and conservation impact  
- Watershed health and water quality  
- Migratory birds and wildlife corridors  

### **Tertiary Domains (supporting but valuable)**
- Climate resilience in local ecosystems  
- Wildlife monitoring and restoration  
- Sustainable land use in rural communities  

This map should be updated annually as programs evolve.

## 4. Content Structure Standards  
All content — preserve pages, stories, campaigns, educational articles — should follow these principles.

### **A. Lead with the answer**
Start with a clear, simple explanation before elaborating.

### **B. Use question-driven sections**
Helps LLMs (and people) quickly locate meaning:
- What makes this preserve unique?  
- Why is this habitat ecologically important?  
- How does DCLT protect this land?  
- What can visitors expect?  

### **C. Use tight paragraphs**
1–3 sentences max.  
Short paragraphs are not only acceptable — they are preferred by modern search systems.

### **D. Build in “entity anchors”**
Intentionally incorporate:
- Preserve name  
- Habitat type  
- Geographic context  
- Species or ecological features  
- Connection to DCLT’s mission  

### **E. Add structured data (schema)**
Where appropriate:
- `Article`  
- `Event`  
- `Organization`  
- `Place`  
- `FAQ`  

This increases machine understanding dramatically.

## 5. Content Types That Build Long-Term Authority  
To strengthen DCLT’s presence in AI search, prioritize these categories:

### **A. Preserve & Habitat Pages**
These should become definitive sources.
- Ecology  
- Trails  
- Key species  
- Restoration work  
- Land acquisition history  

### **B. Ecosystem Explainers**
Short, structured pages on:
- Boreal forest patches  
- Wetlands and vernal streams  
- Escarpment cliffs  
- Shoreline habitats  

### **C. Land Protection Guides**
Clear, non-technical explainers:
- How conservation easements work  
- Steps to protect your land  
- Options for donating land  
- Benefits and implications  

### **D. Stories & Announcements**
Kept clean, factual, structured:
- Land acquisition stories  
- Donor narratives  
- Stewardship updates  

### **E. Knowledge Articles**
Educational content written in an authoritative tone.

## 6. Workflow: How to Create AI-Optimized Content  
A simple, repeatable process for all new content.

### **Before Writing**
- Identify the primary question the content must answer.  
- Select 2–4 relevant entities from the Domain Authority Map.  
- Determine how the piece ties back to DCLT’s mission.

### **While Writing**
- Start with the answer.  
- Use semantic headers.  
- Keep paragraphs short.  
- Add mission context naturally.  
- Use specific ecological facts where applicable.

### **After Writing**
- Add internal links to related preserves or topics.  
- Add schema if applicable.  
- Review for clarity and directness.  
- Ensure naming consistency (preserve names, ecosystems, species).  
- Update the sitemap and Storytelling Pipeline.

## 7. How This Strategy Integrates With Existing Hubs  
This is a cross-cutting strategy intentionally designed to work with:

- **Audience Segmentation & Mapping**  
  (Tailor content structure to persona needs.)

- **Alternative Messaging Strategy**  
  (Seed entity-rich, values-forward language.)

- **Storytelling Strategy & Campaign Framework**  
  (Authority-building stories tie ecological facts to mission outcomes.)

- **Website Strategy Hub**  
  (IA, templates, and schema live here; authority strategy overlays on top.)

- **Membership Strategy**  
  (Pages explaining member impact can be built using the same structural principles.)

This document governs *how* content is conceptualized, not what the templates look like.

---

## 8. Implementation Priorities for 2026  
A clear, actionable roadmap:

1. **Rebuild preserve pages using entity-rich templates.**  
2. **Publish short ecosystem explainers across all habitat types.**  
3. **Integrate structured schema into hero blocks, FAQ sections, and preserves.**  
4. **Ensure internal cross-linking supports authority mapping.**  
5. **Embed this workflow into all future storytelling and campaign writing.**  
6. **Create an annual review cycle to update pages for recency signals.**  
7. **Measure visibility in LLM search using periodic test queries (ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.).**

---

## 9. Guiding Principle  
**DCLT becomes the canonical voice of Door County conservation.**  
When someone asks an AI about ecology, habitats, land protection, or preserves in Door County, the answer should draw from your content because you consistently publish:

- factual,  
- structured,  
- authoritative,  
- mission-aligned information.

This strategy sets the foundation for that future.
