# — Modern Membership Strategy & Research Brief

## *Door County Land Trust | June 2025*

---

## 🌟 Objective

To reimagine how land trusts and conservation nonprofits can structure supporter engagement beyond outdated membership models—by integrating audience psychographics, behavioral science, and nonprofit innovation.

---

## 🧠 Core Insight

> Membership is no longer a transaction.
> 
> 
> It’s an **invitation to belong**, to act, and to identify with the cause.
>

## 🛍️ SECTION 1: Generational Attitudes Toward Membership

| Generation | Belonging Style | What Builds Trust | What Repels |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Gen Z** (<27) | Movement-based, participatory | Authenticity, peer action, climate impact | Formality, exclusivity, paper newsletters |
| **Millennials**(28–44) | Identity-driven, cause-aligned | Transparency, emotional storytelling, digital access | Complexity, unclear CTAs |
| **Gen X** (45–60) | Pragmatic, family-legacy oriented | Stewardship, flexibility, smart use of resources | Bureaucracy, wasteful swag |
| **Boomers** (61+) | Institutional loyalty, values-driven | Longevity, legacy, land permanence | Rapid change, disregard for tradition |

---

## 🧬 SECTION 2: Behavioral Drivers of Engagement

| Motivator | Example | Membership Implication |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🧠 **Cognitive Ease** | Simple CTAs, clear tiers | “Join at any level” vs “Choose from 7 giving programs” |
| ❤️ **Emotional Connection** | Story-based giving | “Help protect this place” over “General support” |
| 🢑 **Social Proof** | Peer quotes, member spotlights | “You’re joining 1,200 neighbors” |
| ⏳ **Urgency + Impact** | Seasonal drives, match campaigns | “Land at risk today” → join now |
| 🎯 **Identity Affirmation** | Tier naming, role framing | “Legacy Guardian” or “Wild Door Sustainer” vs “Member” |

---

## 🛠️ SECTION 3: Case Study Highlights

### 🌲 Jackson Hole Land Trust

- Uses **storytelling** and strong CE pathways
- “Join the Cause” > “Become a Member”
- Visual clarity + family legacy appeals

### 👇 REI Co-op

- Membership = **lifestyle identity**, not donation
- Emphasizes **shared values + sustainability**
- One-time buy-in → lifetime connection

### 🐾 Save the Redwoods League

- Tier names rooted in **place and purpose**
- Impact-forward content, **movement-aligned** brand
- Language: “Be a forest advocate,” not “donate now”

### 🐦 Audubon

- Multi-entry pathways (bird ID, garden programs, policy alerts)
- High-volume low-barrier engagement
- Data-rich, segmented retention flows

## 🧱 SECTION 4: Structural Alternatives to Traditional Membership

| Model | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🎮 **Narrative Tiers** | Use titles like “Habitat Guardian” or “Legacy Steward” | Matches mission with identity |
| 🌍 **Movement Framing** | Belonging to a collective effort | “Join the Wild Door Movement” |
| ♻️ **Seasonal Pledges** | Quarterly or campaign-based giving | “Spring Preserve Challenge” |
| 📋 **Subscription Giving** | Recurring, customizable, impact-linked | Monthly “Sustainer” tiers |
| 🤝 **Ambassador Programs** | Invite supporters to engage, recruit, host | Volunteers, landowners, young leaders |

---

## ✍️ SECTION 5: Messaging Framework

| Traditional | Reframed |
| --- | --- |
| Become a Member | Join the Movement to Protect Door County |
| Renew Your Membership | Keep the Protection Going |
