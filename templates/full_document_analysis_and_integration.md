I have a new document at [FILE_PATH] that needs intelligent integration into the strategic planning system.

**Analysis Tasks:**
1. **Content Analysis**: Break down the document into distinct sections/insights
2. **Duplication Check**: Identify any content that already exists in the system
3. **Strategic Mapping**: Determine which parts align with existing strategic themes
4. **Integration Recommendations**: Suggest where different sections should go

**Integration Options**:
- **Whole Document**: Move entire document to single location
- **Section Split**: Extract sections to different strategic areas
- **Insight Synthesis**: Merge key insights into existing documents
- **Reference Addition**: Add as supporting material to existing work
- **Duplicate Handling**: Mark redundant content and suggest consolidation

**Frontmatter & Linking Tasks**:
- **Add/Update Frontmatter**: Ensure proper YAML with strategic_theme, stakeholders, tags, etc.
- **Create Backlinks**: Add [[Document Name]] links TO this document from related strategic files
- **Create Forward Links**: Add links FROM this document to relevant existing content
- **Update Cross-References**: Modify existing documents to reference new insights

**Output**:
- Integration plan showing what goes where
- Frontmatter schema for new/modified documents
- List of existing documents that should be updated/linked
- Comprehensive linking strategy (both directions)
- Identification of any new strategic insights

Execute the recommended integration plan including all frontmatter and linking updates.
