# —— Strategic Summary: Evolving Membership into a Movement

## **🧠 THE GIST:**

**You’re not asking people to “become members.”**

**You’re inviting them to belong to a movement.**

> Traditional membership says:
> 

> “Here’s a card. You get a newsletter.”
> 

> Modern belonging says:
> 

> “This place needs you. Here’s how you can protect it—on your terms.”
>

## **🔄 OLD PARADIGM VS. NEW PARADIGM**

| **Old Membership Model** | **New Belonging Model** |
| --- | --- |
| Fixed tiers, annual dues | Flexible, identity-driven paths to action |
| Emphasis on benefits | Emphasis on impact + shared values |
| “Join / Renew” | “Act / Belong / Sustain” |
| Generic appeals | Personalized invitations, stories, and psychographic segments |
| Focus on money | Focus on movement—money is one expression of support |

### **🚀 Next-Level Thinking for DCLT**

### **1. Replace Transaction with Transformation**

Supporters don’t “give”—they **join a shared story**:

- Protecting cherished land
- Passing on legacy
- Standing with community in shared purpose

---

### **2. Segment by Motivation, Not Just Giving Level**

Offer tailored paths for:

- 🧭 Landowners → “Protect your land with our help”
- 👨‍👩‍👧 Families → “Be part of restoring Door County”
- 🌱 Youth & nature-lovers → “$5/month protects this trail”

Let people **see themselves in the movement.**

---

### **3. Modular Engagement Funnel**

Create layered options instead of a single “Join” button:

- Take a quiz: *“What kind of land protector are you?”*
- Pledge support
- Volunteer or attend
- Subscribe for seasonal stories
- Choose one-time, monthly, or legacy giving when ready

---

### **4. Shared, Movement-Based Language**

Replace “member” with mission-aligned terms:

> Wild Door Sustainer, Habitat Guardian, Bluebird Ally, Legacy Land Partner
> 

Write with **you-focused language**:

- “You protect these places.”
- “You make this story possible.”
- “You’re part of something rooted and rare.”

---

### **5. Make It Feel Like a Movement**

- Feature supporter maps, names, or stories
- Offer stewardship rituals (e.g., seasonal pledges, “Land Heroes”)
- Provide shareable resources (“Spread the Wild” toolkit)
- Build meaning through **community and identity**, not just dues

---

### **✅ Immediate Opportunities**

- Restructure your Supporter Landing Page
- Update CTAs across website and email flows
- Test psychographic-driven welcome journeys
- Align CRM tags with interests and engagement paths
- Develop a storytelling-driven ask calendar
