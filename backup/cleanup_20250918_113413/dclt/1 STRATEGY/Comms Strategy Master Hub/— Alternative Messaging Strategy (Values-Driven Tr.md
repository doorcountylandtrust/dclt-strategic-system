# — Alternative Messaging Strategy (Values-Driven Track)

### **Purpose**

This page outlines a **parallel communications strategy** that introduces bolder, more values-driven messaging to better reflect the urgent realities of land conservation in Door County. It is designed to *complement*, not replace, our current approach—allowing us to test more activist-aligned language without risking wholesale brand alienation.

This approach names threats like sprawl and overdevelopment, centers mission-first storytelling, and energizes audiences who are ready to defend Door County’s wild identity.

---

## **🔁 Strategic Shift Summary**

| **Theme** | **Current Messaging** | **Alternative Messaging** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Tone** | Neutral, reverent | Urgent, protective, values-based |
| **Core Message** | “Preserve the natural beauty of Door County.” | “Stop sprawl. Protect what’s left—before it’s gone.” |
| **Villain** | Absent or abstract (e.g., “habitat loss”) | Named threats (e.g., “reckless development”, “short-term profit”) |
| **Hero** | The land trust or members | People willing to stand up for the land |
| **Call to Action** | “Become a member.” | “Join the resistance to sprawl. Defend Door County.” |

### **Moderate Bold:**

> “What we don’t protect, gets paved. We’re not anti-growth—we’re anti-
> 
>

## **🧪 Pilot Campaign Concepts**

### **🧭 1. “Protect What’s Left” Campaign**

- Visual social/email series comparing saved vs. lost landscapes
- Interactive map or carousel: *“This could’ve been bulldozed”*

### **🗣️ 2. Blog Series:**

### **“The Cost of Growth”**

- First-person and place-based storytelling on overdevelopment’s consequences
- Topics: groundwater, traffic, vanishing farmland

### **🧱 3. “Land Defenders” Donor Tier**

- A donor circle for those aligned with bolder protection
- Branded language and content (e.g., digital badge, storytelling features)

### **📣 4. Op-Ed or Panel:**

### **“The Future of Wild Door County”**

- Host or support community discussion on land use and growth
- Feature a mix of partners, from planners to youth leaders

## **📊 Metrics to Monitor**

| **Metric** | **Indicator of Success** |
| --- | --- |
| **Clickthrough Rate** | Email tests: bold vs. traditional messaging |
| **New Donor Leads** | From bold message channels |
| **Engagement** | Shares/comments on activist-aligned content |
| **Segment Response** | Survey feedback from traditional vs. bold-leaning supporters |

- 🧭 **Values-forward, not partisan**
- 🤝 **Bridge-building tone:** We name the problem *without vilifying individuals*
- 📜 **In compliance with Land Trust Alliance standards**

---

## **🛠️ Content & Execution Timeline**

| **Phase** | **Action** |
| --- | --- |
| Week 1–2 | Draft 3 core message variations; assign to channels |
| Week 3–4 | Design & launch “Protect What’s Left” as a test campaign |
| Week 5–6 | Gather email and social performance data |
| Week 7 | Internal review of impact and donor response |
| Week 8 | Decide whether to scale, pause, or revise the approach |

### **🎚️ Segmented Boldness: Turning the Screw Where We Can**

We don’t need to flip the switch on a fully activist brand overnight. Instead, we **strategically apply pressure based on audience type, context, and channel**—turning the screw where and when we can.

---

### **🧠 The Strategy**

Messaging boldness is not binary. It’s a **dial**. We use segmentation and tone control to apply the right amount of values-driven language in the right places.

---

### **🗂️ Tone-by-Segment Table**

| **Audience Segment** | **Message Style** | **Sample CTA** | **Primary Channels** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Legacy Donors (65+) | Reverent, honoring legacy | “Continue the legacy you helped start.” | Print, direct mail |
| Younger Subscribers / Prospects | Urgent, activist-flavored | “Stop reckless development. Protect what’s left.” | Social, email |
| Community Partners / Planners | Strategic, policy-aware | “We work with landowners to resist overdevelopment.” | Op-eds, panels |
| High-Capacity Donors | Bold but data-backed | “Your leadership can defend what Door County can’t replace.” | Personal outreach |

## **📌 When to Dial It Up**

| **oment** | **Boldness Level** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Social posts about land loss | Medium-bold | Visual storytelling; name threats like sprawl |
| Newsletter features | Soft-bold | Spotlight solutions with subtle urgency |
| Advocacy emails | Bold | Name specific issues, suggest public action |
| Youth-oriented campaigns | Very bold | Use modern activist tone, short copy, action verbs |

## **🔍 Survey Validation & Audience Insights (Values-Driven Lens)**

**Context:**

This section analyzes insights from the 2025 Member Survey through the lens of our bold, values-aligned messaging strategy. It helps validate that our most loyal supporters already hold strong conservation values—and, in many cases, are using language aligned with activist positioning.

---

### **🎯 Why This Matters**

These findings suggest we **have permission** to name threats like overdevelopment, frame stewardship as active protection, and build messaging around urgency and legacy.

---

### **🧩 Key Themes Identified from Survey Responses**

**1. Urgency and Threat Recognition**

- “Land needs to be protected from development and overuse.”
- “Imperative not only for the future of the peninsula but the world.”
- “For Door County to be what we love, it is vital to conserve it.”
- “I believe in the need to save and support that which cannot defend itself.”

✅ *Implication: Members already recognize sprawl and overuse as direct threats. Naming these threats aligns with supporter values.*

---

**2. Legacy and Stewardship**

- “I want people in the future to enjoy the natural beauty we have now.”
- “The land needs stewardship.”
- “It preserves what nature and God have given us.”

✅ *Implication: Messaging rooted in legacy, long-term protection, and intergenerational ethics will resonate deeply.*

---

**3. Support for Bold, Balanced Action**

- “Keep up the good work and the good balance of priorities.”
- “May be useful to share administrative overhead to clarify how support is used.”
- “Nope, love what you do. Thank you!”

✅ *Implication: There is no strong backlash against stronger positioning—only a call for clarity and continuity. The door is open.*

---

### **🔎 Additional Quantitative Trends**

- **Most respondents are age 65+ and retired**
- **Many have 25–100+ years of family history in Door County**
- **Preserve visitation is high (2–5+ times/year)**
- **Support is deep: most are financial donors and some are volunteers**

✅ *These are not disengaged subscribers. They are deeply invested in the future of the land.*

---

### **🧠 Interpretation**

- We are not introducing radical new ideas—we’re **giving voice to long-held concerns**.
- Messaging that names overdevelopment as a threat will not alienate most loyal supporters if it is **grounded in shared values** like stewardship, legacy, and love of place.
- Strong, values-forward messaging should be **targeted** and **tonally calibrated**—but not avoided.
