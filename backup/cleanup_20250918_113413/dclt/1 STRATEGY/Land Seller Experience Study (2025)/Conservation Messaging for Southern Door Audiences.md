# Conservation Messaging for Southern Door Audiences

## Purpose

Develop a tailored communications and outreach strategy to engage landowners in **Southern Door County**, whose cultural, economic, and political profiles differ from those in Northern Door. The goal is to increase land conservation activity (including land donations and bargain sales) through messaging, values framing, and outreach strategies that resonate with this unique audience.

---

## Why This Matters

- Southern Door has **more available land** but often **lower philanthropic liquidity**.
- Landowners tend to be **land-rich, cash-poor**.
- Political and cultural orientation trends **more conservative**, with values around family legacy, privacy, independence, and property rights.
- DCLT's current messaging may **not fully connect** with this audience — especially if it's perceived as too progressive, abstract, or institutional.
- Unlocking this segment could yield **significant conservation gains** over the next decade.

## Target Audience Snapshot

| Attribute | Northern Door (Baseline) | Southern Door (Target) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Financial Profile | Wealthier, more liquid | Land-rich, cash-poor |
| Political Leaning | Progressive-leaning | Conservative-leaning |
| Motivations | Climate, habitat, legacy | Family, privacy, tradition |
| Outreach Channels | Events, email, digital | Word-of-mouth, print, 1:1 trust |
| Tone Preference | Visionary, inclusive | Practical, direct, respectful |

## Early Strategic Questions

- What stories and messengers will earn trust in Southern Door?
- Are there specific emotional frames we can tap into? (e.g., "Protecting what’s yours", "Leaving the land better than you found it")
- What language is **off-putting** vs. **resonant**? (e.g., “climate change” vs. “extreme weather” or “land health”)
- Who are the **trusted influencers** — realtors, township officials, neighbors, hunting groups, church networks?
- Are there **alternative giving models or incentives** that make this more appealing (e.g., tax relief, shared-use easements, installment donations)?
- Should we develop **custom print collateral** or in-person outreach plans?
- What are **perceived barriers** to land donation in Southern Door? (e.g. mistrust of gov/nonprofits, family land legacies, fear of losing control)
- Who are the **trusted messengers** in this community? (e.g. realtors, farmers, township officials, hunters, neighbors)
- What emotional frames resonate more: **heritage**, **self-reliance**, **property rights**, **land as family legacy**, **Biblical stewardship**?
- What **language** backfires? (e.g. “climate change,” “equity”) And what could be used instead? (“generational care,” “conserving what’s ours”)
- Are there **tax advantages or financial incentives** that could be emphasized, especially for land-rich, cash-poor individuals?

## Potential Messaging Frames

| Frame | Description | Sample Language |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Legacy Stewardship** | Emphasizes passing land on in a meaningful way | “You’ve cared for this land your whole life — this ensures it stays protected.” |
| **Keep It Rural** | Appeals to anti-development sentiment without politics | “Stop sprawl. Protect the rural way of life.” |
| **Landowner Control** | Counters fear of regulation/loss of agency | “You choose how it’s protected. We’re here to help you make it happen.” |
| **Family First** | Taps into generational identity | “Conserve your land for your children’s future, on your terms.” |

---

## Tactics & Channels

- **Targeted landowner mailings** (with language localized to Southern Door)
- **1:1 meetings with known local landowners**
- **Partnerships with local realtors or tax advisors** who understand their mindset
- **Print pieces left at town halls, ag suppliers, churches**
- **Success stories from similar landowners**, shared via postcards or direct mail
- **Non-political visual framing** (e.g., legacy, landscape, family working the land)

## Peer Influence Messaging Examples

Carl Barnard’s speech presents a powerful example of a peer-led, emotionally grounded conservation message that could resonate especially with:

- Southern Door landowners
- Farmers whose children live out-of-state
- Those disillusioned with suburban sprawl

Suggested pull quote:

> “People won’t remember who I am, but they’ll remember what this land is because it will always be here.”
>

## Potential Collaborators

- Land Director (strategy + introductions)
- Development team (to frame giving structures that work)
- GIS / Data (identify parcels of high conservation potential)
- Local realtors and land use attorneys
- Neighbor landowners who have already conserved land
