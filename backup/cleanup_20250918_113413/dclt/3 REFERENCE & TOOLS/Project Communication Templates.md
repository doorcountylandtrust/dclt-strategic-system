# Project Communication Templates

Historical document lives at '/Volumes/DCLT/MOD (Membership Outreach Development) Program/Communications and Outreach/Marketing Plan/Project_Communication_Plan_Template.pdf’

**1. Why Communication Plans Matter**

- Reinforces why upfront communication planning is critical to meeting deadlines and expectations.
- Encourages *clear role assignments, predictable check-ins*, and *executive-level summaries* for stakeholders.
- Advocates for moving from ad hoc to systematized comms - helpful if you're trying to improve internal project management.

**2. Practical Framework**

- Includes a sample and blank communication plan: deliverables, dates, roles, tools, and contact info.
- Could serve as a **template** for internal projects (e.g., your website redesign, branding process, or stewardship campaigns).
- Might inspire a **Notion-based version** tailored to DCLT projects, especially if you're coordinating across staff and contractors.

**3. Communication Tool Mapping**

- Shows how to align communication channels (e.g., Join.me, email) to specific deliverables.
- While dated, the logic still applies if you're defining what gets shared where (Teams vs. email vs. meetings).
