### **🧠 Brand SWOT Analysis**

**Strengths:**

- Clear and long-standing mission
- Trusted and trustworthy regional identity
- Recognizable Door County elements (bluffs, water, bird)
- Archway/window motif offers visual familiarity and meaning
- Deep support from long-time donors and volunteers

**Weaknesses:**

- Logo perceived as outdated, bland, or overly formal
- Design includes confusing elements (e.g., “teepee trees”)
- Weak emotional resonance, especially for newer audiences
- Visual system lacks scalability and flexibility
- Typography and layout vary inconsistently across channels

**Opportunities:**

- Create a **“Modern Heritage”** aesthetic blending legacy and freshness
- Differentiate design for audience segments (legacy vs. active participants)
- Center brand around authentic local landscapes + human presence
- Expand content types: landowner stories, videos, seasonal campaigns
- Build a modular, multi-platform design system (print, digital, merch)

**Threats:**

- Alienation of legacy supporters if change feels abrupt or impersonal
- Volunteer disengagement due to lost sense of relationship and warmth
- Donor expectations shifting toward modern visual storytelling
- Competing organizations adopting more contemporary brand systems

---

### **🧭 Use Patterns & Engagement Preferences**

**Common Logo Placements:**

- Email headers
- Hike leader vests
- Preserve signage
- Brochures and donor letters
- Membership cards

**Messaging Taglines in Use:**

- “Protecting Door County’s Exceptional Lands and Waters… Forever”

**Generational Content Preferences:**

- 🧓 *Legacy Conservationists* → prefer printed newsletters, mailed calendars, formal donor materials
- 🧑‍💻 *Active Participants* → prefer video, social media, volunteer updates, interactive content
- 📸 *Shared priority*: Land protection stories, landowner motivation, and clear conservation impact

---

### **✅ Recommendations (From Brand Audit + Focus Group Insights)**

- Modernize the logo while preserving beloved symbolic elements (archway, bluff, bird, water)
- Develop a **multi-tiered visual system**:
    - *Legacy-facing*: Clean, classic, professional tone
    - *Public-facing*: Warm, inviting, nature-forward tone
- Introduce flexible brand elements: patterns, textures, iconography, seasonal graphics
- Build a modular visual system that supports storytelling blocks, print collateral, and digital templates
- Update typography and color palette for accessibility, contrast, and generational appeal
- Align brand assets with content needs across generational engagement channels
- Document visual and verbal brand guidelines to ensure long-term consistency and handoff readiness
