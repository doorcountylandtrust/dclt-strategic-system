title: Designer Collaboration & Pre-Design Kickoff
---\n\n# Designer Collaboration & Pre-Design Kickoff

This document outlines how designers will collaborate on brand identity explorations for Door County Land Trust. It ensures clarity, fairness, and alignment with organizational values.

---

## 1. Purpose

- Avoid “winner-take-all bakeoff” dynamics.
- Frame all concepts as *parallel explorations* of shared values, not competing designer outputs.
- Ensure both designers feel included, respected, and supported.
- Build a foundation for collaborative refinement once initial concepts are developed.

---

## 2. Pre-Design Kickoff

### **a. Shared Brainstorm (1–2 hrs)**

- Review the **Values & Keywords (Quick Reference Checklist)**.
- Map possible directions (e.g., bluff realism, stylized heritage marks, water emphasis, flora/fauna inclusion).
- Identify *must-haves* (bluff, water, no gradients) vs. *flexible elements* (tree species, fauna, typography).

### **b. Divvy Up Idea Spaces (examples)**

- Designer A: Explore **realistic/landform fidelity** directions.
- Designer B: Explore **stylized/heritage mark** directions.*(Adjust division based on interests and strengths.)*

### **c. Alignment Check**

- Confirm what each designer will explore (2 directions each).
- Agree on level of fidelity (logo sketches + minimal applications, not full brand systems yet).
- Set a checkpoint date for first share-back.

---

## 3. Concept Depth (Round 1)

Each designer develops **two independent concepts**:

- Logo mark (with text treatment where relevant).
- Simple applications (signage mockup, digital thumbnail, print test).
- Optional: small supporting element (icon/ornamental/illustrative) if it reinforces the direction.

Deliverables are exploratory, not polished final art.

---

## 4. Collaboration Guidelines

- **Independence in Execution**: Each designer creates their own files and owns their 2 directions.
- **Mutual Support**: Designers share progress and seek feedback based on strengths (e.g., typography, illustration, mockups).
- **Neutral Presentation**: When shared with stakeholders, concepts are framed as *team explorations*.
- **Evaluation Neutrality**: Scoring rubric is applied equally across all directions, regardless of author.
- **Refinement Round**: Once one or two directions rise to the top, *both designers* contribute to evolving the chosen design(s).

---

## 5. Evaluation & Next Steps

1. Conduct scoring rubric session with the stakeholder group.
2. Identify high-scoring directions and gaps.
3. Both designers collaborate on refinement of selected direction(s).
4. Document process and decisions for continuity and transparency.
