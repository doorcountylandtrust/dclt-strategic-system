Priority: High
Start Date: July 16, 2025

Task Role: Subtask

Draft the core storytelling messages that tie land conservation, legacy, and ecological health into a coherent identity for DCLT’s outreach.

To establish a consistent, compelling narrative framework rooted in mission, values, and audience motivations—used across campaigns, website, donor appeals, and outreach.

---

### **🔍 Scope**

- Aligns with: Strategic Plan                                ([[Campaigns]]), Visual Identity, Audience Segmentation, and the 2025 Comms Plan
- Serves as a messaging spine for all storytelling—written, spoken, and visual
- Designed to work across multiple platforms: web, print, email, social, video

---

### **📁 Components**

- 3–5 core narrative “pillars” that encapsulate key ideas (e.g., “Land Legacy,” “Community Stewardship,” “Nature’s Resilience”)
- Each includes:
    - Title + taglines or shorthand
    - Emotional drivers (hope, urgency, belonging, awe, etc.)
    - Associated calls to action
    - Suggested audiences
    - Example phrases and tone

---

### **🧩 Integration**

These pillars will inform:

- Website content blocks
- Email series
- Video scripts
- Campaign one-pagers
- Story-based donor segmentation
- Staff/board talking points

---

### **✅ Definition of Done**

- [ ]  3–5 narrative pillars are defined with emotional drivers and example language
- [ ]  Each pillar is mapped to at least one key audience/persona
- [ ]  Visual and story applications have been tested across two formats (e.g., email, landing page, donor appeal)
- [ ]  Pillars reviewed and validated by internal stakeholders (e.g., Dev + Outreach + Executive)
- [ ]  Pillars documented in the Messaging System and linked from the Comms Strategy hub
