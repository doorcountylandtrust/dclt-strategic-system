**📝 Story Draft: “The Prairie That Came Back to Life”**

> For years, this land stood silent. Once a thriving prairie, it had been plowed over for farming, its wildflowers replaced by rows of corn, its wetlands drained. The deer that once grazed here were long gone. The soil dry and lifeless.
> 

> But in 2015, something changed.
> 

> The Johnson family, who had owned this land for generations, made a decision. Instead of selling to developers, they worked with DCLT to restore the prairie—protecting it forever.
> 

> It wasn’t easy. Years of invasive grasses had to be cleared. Wetlands restored. Native plants reintroduced.
> 

> Today, the purple coneflowers sway in the wind. Monarch butterflies dance above the milkweed. At dawn, sandhill cranes call out. Their voices echo over the restored wetlands.
> 

> “When I walk this land now, I feel like it’s breathing again,” says Sarah Johnson, whose great-grandfather once plowed this field. “I see what my ancestors saw. And I know my grandchildren will see it too.”
> 

> This is the power of conservation. The land, once forgotten, now tells its story again.
