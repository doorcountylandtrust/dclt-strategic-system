# Email Templates for Outreach

## **✉️ Landowner Outreach Email Template**

**Subject:** Reflecting on Your Land Sale to DCLT

Hi [First Name],

I’m Don Krumpos, the Communications Manager at Door County Land Trust. I’m reaching out on behalf of Door County Land Trust as part of a short interview project. We’re speaking with past landowners who sold or donated land to DCLT, to better understand what motivated them, what the process was like, and what we can improve in the future.

Your story could help shape how we connect with and support future landowners in making conservation-minded decisions.

**The conversation would take about 30–45 minutes** and can be by phone, Zoom, or in-person — whatever works best for you.

If you’re open to chatting, just reply to this email and let me know your availability over the next few weeks. And of course, if you’d prefer not to participate, no problem at all — just let me know.

Warmly,

Don Krumpos

**Subject:** Quick Conversation? Realtor Role in DCLT Land Sales

Hi [First Name],

I’m Don Krumpos, the Communications Manager at Door County Land Trust. I’m reaching out on behalf of Door County Land Trust. We’re conducting a short interview series to better understand the experiences of those involved in past land transactions with us — including realtors who played a key role in the process.

Your perspective could help us improve how we engage with sellers and their advisors in future land protection efforts.

The interview would take about 30–45 minutes and can be by phone, Zoom, or in-person — whichever you prefer.

Let me know if you’d be open to a short conversation and what your availability looks like in the next few weeks.

Best regards,

Don Krumpos
