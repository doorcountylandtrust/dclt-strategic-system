# — Brand Archetypes

💡 *How to Use This Page*

Use these archetypes to guide campaign language, social copy, donor messaging, and program materials. Combine tones where appropriate (e.g., Hero urgency + Caregiver warmth).

### **The Caregiver** - The Caregiver archetype focuses on nurturing, protecting, and creating stability for others. It’s driven by altruism and service.

Traits:

- Core Desire: To help and protect others (or the land, wildlife, and future generations in this case).
- Goal: To preserve and sustain wildlands and water for the benefit of the environment and communities.
- Strategy: Act responsibly, provide stability, and create lasting impact through care and stewardship.
- Voice: Empathetic, nurturing, protective, and grounded.

### The Explorer - The Explorer archetype is also highly relevant for land trusts, especially if your organization emphasizes adventure, discovery, and connection to wild places.

Traits:

- Core Desire: To seek freedom and explore uncharted or protected lands.
- Goal: To preserve the beauty and wildness of nature, enabling others to explore and connect with it.
- Strategy: Highlight the untamed beauty of nature, inspire action through adventure, and advocate for conservation.
- Voice: Adventurous, inspiring, bold, and forward-thinking.

### The Hero - The Hero focuses on taking bold, decisive action to solve problems and create lasting change. It’s driven by the desire to prove its strength, inspire others, and make the world a better place.

Traits:

- Core Desire: To make the world better by overcoming great challenges (e.g., saving wildlands and protecting biodiversity).
- Goal: To inspire action, demonstrate strength, and lead the charge in solving environmental issues.
- Strategy: Act decisively, demonstrate courage, and mobilize others to join the cause.
- Voice: Empowering, bold, confident, and focused on action.

## Brand Messaging:

**Hero Tone:**

- “Join the fight to save our wildlands and waters before it’s too late!”
- "Take bold action to save our lands and waters—together, we can overcome the greatest challenges."
- “Be a hero for our County’s wild places”

**Caregiver Tone:**

- “Together, we can protect and care for the places we love for generations to come.”
- "Safeguard the places we love, protecting fragile ecosystems for the future."
- “Protect the lands that protect us all”

**Explorer Tone:**

- "Discover the beauty of the untamed wildlands and rekindle your connection to nature."
- “Discover wild lands worth exploring and preserving.”

**Visuals:**

Use bold, dynamic visuals (Hero) alongside calming, natural imagery (Caregiver). For example, action shots of people working in the field could pair with serene landscapes of thriving ecosystems.

**Voice:**

Combine urgency (Hero) with compassion (Caregiver). For example: “Our wildlands need your help now more than ever—join us to ensure they stay safe and healthy for years to come.”

**Call-to-Action:**

- Hero: “Be the hero our environment needs—act now!”
- Caregiver: “Help us nurture and protect our shared legacy.”
- Explorer: “Discover the wild places worth protecting.”
