# — Logo & Visual Identity Evaluation Roadmap

**Purpose:**

Provide a transparent, mission-aligned scoring system to evaluate design concepts objectively—reducing reliance on subjective taste and ensuring buy-in from all stakeholders.

---

## 1. Evaluation Process

1. **Gather Concepts**
    - Present each logo or identity piece at the same scale and context (e.g., on signage, digital, print).
    - Avoid designer commentary—let the work speak first.
2. **Independent Scoring**
    - Each reviewer completes the rubric privately before group discussion.
    - Use the same rubric for *all* concepts.
3. **Group Synthesis**
    - Compare scores.
    - Discuss large scoring gaps.
    - Identify patterns in preferences and concerns.
4. **Decision Path**
    - Shortlist top-scoring concepts.
    - Identify refinement needs.
    - Repeat evaluation after revisions if necessary.

## 2. Rubric Structure

| **Category** | **Definition** | **Weight** | **Score (1–5)** | **Weighted Score** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mission Alignment | Reflects conservation values, trust, permanence, and focus group insights | 25% |  |  |
| Authenticity | Feels true to Door County’s landscape, community, and history | 15% |  |  |
| Distinctiveness | Stands out from other land trusts and local orgs | 15% |  |  |
| Adaptability | Works across signage, print, web, social, and merch | 15% |  |  |
| Emotional Resonance | Evokes pride, trust, and care for the land | 10% |  |  |
| Readability/Clarity | Legible at all sizes, symbol clear without text | 10% |  |  |
| Longevity | Likely to remain relevant 10–20 years | 10% |  |  |

**Scoring Key:**

1 = Poor | 2 = Fair | 3 = Acceptable | 4 = Strong | 5 = Excellent

---

## 3. Focus Group–Derived Values & Keywords

(*quick reference checklist* )

*(Use these as “truth anchors” for scoring in each category)*

- **Core Values:** Trust, Legacy, Realism, Stewardship, Permanence
- **Design Tone:** Serious but welcoming, grounded, natural beauty without cliché
- **Symbol Preferences:** Bluff, water, sky, native flora/fauna; avoid overly abstract or playful forms
- **Execution Priorities:** Consistency across mediums, accurate landscape representation, no overused national symbols (e.g., eagles) unless contextually justified

---

## 4. Implementation                             Notes

- **Weighted Scoring Formula:** `(Score x Weight) = Weighted Score`
- **Total Possible:** 5.00 (100%)
- **Decision Threshold:** Shortlist designs with a score ≥ 4.0 and no single category < 3.0
- **Documentation:** Store completed rubrics here for decision history
- **Revisions:** Use category feedback to guide targeted refinements

---

## 5. Next Steps

1. Finalize rubric categories & weights with design team.
2. Test rubric on a small set of concepts to confirm clarity.
3. Use rubric for all remaining design presentations.
4. Archive scores + notes for board review.
