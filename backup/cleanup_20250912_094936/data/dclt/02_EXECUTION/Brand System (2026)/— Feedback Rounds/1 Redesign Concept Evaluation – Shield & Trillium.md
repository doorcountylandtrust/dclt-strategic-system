# 1. Redesign Concept Evaluation – Shield & Trillium

# Overview

This evaluation uses the **Logo & Visual Identity Rubric** to assess the existing Door County Land Trust logo. Purpose is to document how the current mark aligns (or fails to align) with conservation values, focus group feedback, and long-term identity needs.

## Scoring Rubric

| **Category** | **Definition** | **Weight** | **Score (1–5)** | **Weighted Score** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Mission Alignment** | Reflects conservation values, trust, permanence, and focus group insights | 25% | 3 | 0.75 | Represents land + water + trillium, but feels “sanitized” and too formal. |
| **Authenticity** | Feels true to Door County’s landscape, community, and history | 15% | 3 | 0.45 | General Door County feel, but not specific/bluff details missing; generic tree + flower. |
| **Distinctiveness** | Stands out from other land trusts and local orgs | 15% | 2 | 0.30 | Similar shield style is common; easily confused with other nonprofits. |
| **Adaptability** | Works across signage, print, web, social, and merch | 15% | 4 | 0.60 | Functional at small sizes; simple shapes scale decently. |
| **Emotional Resonance** | Evokes pride, trust, and care for the land | 10% | 2 | 0.20 | Described by participants as “outdated” and “cold.” Limited emotional pull. |
| **Readability/Clarity** | Legible at all sizes, symbol clear without text | 10% | 4 | 0.40 | Good clarity and legibility, though somewhat flat. |
| **Longevity** | Likely to remain relevant 10–20 years | 10% | 2 | 0.20 | Feels dated today; unlikely to age well another decade. |

**Total Weighted Score:** **2.9 / 5.0 (58%)**

## Key Insights

- **Strengths:** Clear, simple, recognizable form; scales well; does depict bluff + water + trillium.
- **Weaknesses:** Perceived as outdated, sterile, too formal. Fails to spark emotional connection.
- **Focus Group Alignment:** Echoes feedback that the logo “feels sanitized,” lacks warmth, and doesn’t strongly convey authenticity or local specificity.

---

## Recommendation

- **Keep?** ❌ No (not aligned with focus group insights, dated)
- **Evolve?** ✅ Yes (elements like bluffs/water/trillium remain important, but need refreshed execution)
- **Drop?** ❌ Not entirely — symbolic building blocks should inform the new system.

## Next Steps

- Use this evaluation as a **baseline** against which new concepts are scored.
- Ensure new designs improve in **authenticity, distinctiveness, and emotional resonance** while retaining adaptability and clarity.
