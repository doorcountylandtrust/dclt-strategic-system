# —— Land Protection Manager

## **📝 Interview Summary – Land Protection Manager**

### **Website Feedback & Use Cases**

- **Use of website in land acquisition:**
    - Primarily a **reference point**—used by landowners or potential partners to “check things out.”
    - Not a tool for **active outreach** (those are targeted and private).
    - Needs to strike a balance: **credible and informative** but **not overly revealing**.
- **Key problems or opportunities:**
    - There are **persistent rumors and misconceptions** about what DCLT does with acquired land.
    - The public doesn’t understand the differences between:
        - **Land Acquisition** vs. **Conservation Easements (CEs)**
        - **Nature Preserves** vs. **Natural Areas**
    - Common questions include:
        - “What are you going to do with this land?”
        - “Will the public be allowed to access it?”

### **Communications Needs**

- **Clarity of mission and methods:**
    - Clear, accessible explanations are needed to:
        - Differentiate **CEs from acquisitions**
        - Explain how land use decisions are made
        - Communicate the **intent and future** of protected lands
- **Sensitive content handling:**
    - Some topics—especially **land acquisition leads**—should **not be made public**.
    - The website needs **back-end flexibility** or **internal guidance** to avoid oversharing.
- **Education & Trust-building:**
    - A **FAQ page** could help preempt rumors or speculation.
    - This could improve trust and **save staff time** by answering common concerns in a controlled, thoughtful way.

## **🔍 Thematic Analysis**

| **Theme** | **Insight** |
| --- | --- |
| **Public Misunderstanding** | The average visitor doesn’t grasp the nuances between land protection strategies—this creates confusion and occasionally distrust. |
| **Strategic Privacy** | Not all land protection work is for public eyes—website needs clear editorial boundaries. |
| **Educational Opportunity** | With the right tone and structure, the site can proactively educate and build trust without compromising sensitive efforts. |
| **Navigation & Taxonomy** | Current site likely doesn’t reflect internal distinctions like “preserves” vs “natural areas.” Needs clarity for both lay visitors and informed stakeholders. |

## **✅ Key Opportunities**

| **Priority** | **Opportunity** | **Recommendation** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🔴 High | Create a **“Land Protection FAQ”** section | Address misconceptions directly: CE vs. fee title, access policies, what DCLT does with land, how decisions are made. Use plain language and real examples. |
| 🔴 High | Add clearer **taxonomy or filters** for types of land | Let users understand distinctions between **Preserves**, **Natural Areas**, **Working Lands**, **Restricted Areas**, etc. |
| 🟡 Medium | Consider a gated or private tool for landowner engagement | Not public-facing, but a tool (portal or resource page) to support **targeted outreach** workflows. |
| 🟢 Low | Include a “Why Some Lands Aren’t Open to the Public” explainer | Preemptively frame land use decisions to reduce pushback or confusion about access. |
