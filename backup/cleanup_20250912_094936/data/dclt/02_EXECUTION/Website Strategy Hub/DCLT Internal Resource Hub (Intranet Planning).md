# DCLT Internal Resource Hub (Intranet Planning)

*A shared space for staff to access reference info, scripts, tools, and internal updates.*

---

### **🧭 1. Caller Response Reference (Live Call Support)**

*Quick-reference responses and facts for common public inquiries.*

**Land Protection / CE Questions**

- ❓ *“If I put my land in a CE, can the public hike on it?”*
    
    → “No, conservation easements do not require public access unless specified by the landowner.”
    
- ❓ *“Can I still farm or build on my land?”*
    
    → “Each easement is customized—some limit development, others allow traditional land use.”
    

**Hunting & Preserve Use**

- ❓ *“Is hunting allowed on all DCLT land?”*
    
    → “Some DCLT lands allow hunting. Visit the Hunting Program page or call [staff contact name] for details.”
    
- ❓ *“Why isn’t XYZ place open to hiking?”*
    
    → “Some areas are conservation-focused and not open to public use. Our Preserves page shows what’s open.”
    

**Donation & Membership**

- ❓ *“I want to renew. Where’s the right button?”*
    
    → “Click ‘Renew Membership’ on our homepage or visit: [insert GiveLively link]”
    
- ❓ *“Is this donation tax-deductible?”*
    
    → “Yes—DCLT is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit. We’ll provide a receipt.”
