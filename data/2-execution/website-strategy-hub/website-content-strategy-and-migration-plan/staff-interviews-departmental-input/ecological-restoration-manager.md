## **🔍 Thematic Analysis**

| **Theme** | **Insight** |
| --- | --- |
| **Poor discoverability** | Current UI (e.g. hunting form) relies too much on iconography or obscure placements—needs better structure and cues. |
| **Public vs Internal Use** | Some GIS or map tools are best for staff; exposing them publicly can cause confusion or friction. |
| **Resource Hub Potential** | DCLT could expand its role as a **trusted connector** for conservation-minded landowners. |
| **Inclusive Nature Access** | Trail cams and remote experiences could expand DCLT’s mission reach to **people with limited mobility or distant supporters**. |
| **Unvalidated Needs** | Accessibility gaps should be confirmed with **community feedback**, not assumed. |

## **✅ Key Opportunities**

| **Priority** | **Opportunity** | **Recommendation** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🔴 High | Redesign or consolidate **Hunting Information** into a single clear page | Include permission form, updated maps, and FAQs. Use clear CTA buttons instead of obscure icons. |
| 🟡 Medium | Add **virtual nature experiences** (trail cams, time-lapse photos, seasonal snapshots) | Expand your mission reach to those who can’t hike preserves—this aligns with inclusion and engagement goals. |
| 🟡 Medium | Begin scoping a **Landowner Resource Hub** | Curate and centralize tools, agency connections, conservation guides. Position DCLT as a bridge between landowners and expertise. |
| 🟢 Low | Solicit **community feedback on accessibility** needs | Start with a one-question pulse survey or informal outreach—see what people *actually* want. |
| 🟢 Low | Hide or obfuscate **GIS-heavy or tax parcel layers** for public users | Limit to internal staff tools unless contextually necessary on public maps. |
