# CROSS-SYNTHESIS OF STAFF INTERVIEWS

### **DCLT Website & Communications Stakeholder Insights – May 2025**

## **🧠 Core Themes Across Departments**

### **1. Information Architecture Needs Overhaul**

> 🧭 The current site structure buries key content, confuses users, and causes internal inefficiencies.
> 
- Important tools (e.g., **Hunting Program, CE content, Land Inquiry Form**) are hard to find or poorly placed.
- Menu items are illogically ordered and **don’t reflect real user priorities** (e.g., Protect Your Land buried under vague headings).
- Suggestions to consolidate and surface top user actions:
    
    **“Ways to Protect Your Land”** hub, clear CTAs for Donate / Renew / Inquire.
    

---

### **2. Public Confusion About Land Trust Work**

> ❓ Persistent misconceptions are creating friction for donors, landowners, and partners.
> 
- CE = public access (false)
- DCLT = no hunting (not true)
- Land trust = anti-tax, anti-property rights (deep-seated perception in some circles)
- Multiple staff asked for:
    - **Myth-busting FAQs**
    - **Landowner-oriented explainer content**
    - **Unified elevator pitch or cheat sheet**

---

### **3. Website Isn’t Supporting Staff Workflows**

> ⚙️ Multiple teams rely on the website for information-sharing, but it’s not doing the job.
> 
- Hunting maps, CE forms, volunteer forms—all currently **lack integration with Salesforce** or require manual workarounds.
- Stewardship and restoration teams want **project archive pages** for institutional memory and public transparency.
- No back-end structure to support year-over-year updates or cross-department visibility.

---

### **4. Outdated Content + Missed Opportunities for Reuse**

> 📆 Staff mentioned pages that feel outdated, underused, or siloed—many of which could be repurposed as powerful engagement content.
> 
- Examples:
    - “Caring for the Land” page (should reflect real stewardship work)
    - “Resources and Links” (needs invasive species info, seasonal calendars, etc.)
    - “Publications” page not current
    - **Past project documentation** could support donor impact storytelling and volunteer education

---

### **5. Missing the Mark on Membership + CTA Clarity**

> 🧲 Visitors are confused by what it means to be a member, where to renew, and why to give again.
> 
- Multiple calls and emails come in about where/how to renew vs donate
- Staff suggest:
    - A clear **“Renew Your Membership” CTA** on homepage
    - Possibly renaming “Donate Now” depending on audience
    - **Better tiering or naming structure** to reflect value and purpose (reinforces the deep research)

---

### **6. Desire for More Inclusive & Empowering Engagement**

> 🌱 Staff want supporters to see themselves as
> 
> 
> **part of the movement**
> 
- Suggested:
    - Show people as well as places (photography + stories)
    - Include landowners in the “big picture”
    - Provide practical land management tips, calendars, or backyard biodiversity prompts
    - Celebrate **everyday species** (e.g., bluebirds) as much as the rare ones

---

### **7. Events, Access, and Digital Trail Tools Need Work**

> 🗺 People can’t find event info, register easily, or understand which lands are open to what kinds of use.
> 
- Event registration UX is weak; info scattered
- Preserve vs Natural Area = unclear
- Suggested solutions:
    - Add **AllTrails integration or equivalent**
    - Include **mobile-friendly preserve access info**
    - Create **map-based property tool** like Groundswell Conservancy
