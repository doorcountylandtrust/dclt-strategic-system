Issues/Concerns:  Too Much Dense Text – The page is very text-heavy, making it overwhelming for visitors to read through everything. Breaking content into smaller sections with more engaging visuals or interactive elements (e.g., collapsible text blocks) could improve readability.2. Lack of Hierarchy & Visual Contrast – The text-heavy sections don’t have enough variation in formatting to guide the reader’s eye. Using bold callouts, pull quotes, subheadings, and icons could help.3. Header Design is Generic – While the header states the section’s purpose, it lacks visual distinction from other parts of the site. Adding a hero image, a textured background, or a unique treatment could make this section stand out.4. Limited Visual Storytelling – Aside from the timeline graphic, there are very few engaging visual elements. Adding more historical photos, infographics, or an interactive milestone slider would enhance the experience.5. FAQs Look Generic – The expandable FAQ section is practical, but it lacks design elements that make it feel interactive and modern. Consider adding icons, dividers, or animations for a smoother user experience.6. Footer Could Be More Organized – The footer has valuable links, but the text feels dense, and it could benefit from better spacing, dividers, or a restructured layout. A more modern footer could also include social media links and a call-to-action.
Recommendations: Use More Impactful Visuals – Consider adding before-and-after conservation images, historical photos, or interactive maps to make the milestones section more engaging.2. Make the Timeline Interactive – Instead of a static image, an interactive scrolling timeline could allow users to explore key moments dynamically.3. Highlight Key Facts with Icons or Callouts – Breaking long paragraphs into concise facts with icons would improve scannability.4. More Calls to Action (CTA) – Encourage visitors to take action (e.g., “Become a Member,” “Learn More About Our Work,” “Explore Our Protected Lands”). Right now, the page is informative but lacks clear engagement pathways.4. Improve Accessibility – Enhancing contrast and spacing between text blocks, as well as ensuring headings are distinct, will make it easier to navigate for all users.
