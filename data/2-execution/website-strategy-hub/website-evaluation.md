## Key Findings

### Website Architecture & Navigation

**Strengths**:

Logical Categorization – The sections make sense:

"About Us" for organizational credibility.

"How We Save Land" for conservation efforts.

"Preserves to Explore" for engagement with the land.

"Give Generously" for donations.

"Upcoming Events" to involve the community.

Dual Navigation Paths – Having both a list view and a map view in "Preserves to Explore" is an asset, giving users flexibility.

**Weaknesses**:

Overwhelming Top-Level Navigation

Too many primary categories make it difficult to focus.

There should be fewer top-level options with better subcategories.

Example: Instead of "How We Save Land," this could fold into a broader "Conservation" category.

Siloed Information

Key user journeys (e.g., exploring preserves, donating, volunteering) feel disconnected.

Example: The donation call-to-action does not naturally flow from an emotional conservation success story.

Hard to Find Critical Info Quickly

No clear "Start Here" for newcomers.

New users won’t know where to begin.

Suggested fix: Add a prominent button or section for "New to Door County Land Trust? Here's How to Get Involved."

Ineffective Calls to Action (CTAs)

Some CTAs lack urgency or are buried.

A donation button exists, but it doesn’t guide users with why they should give.

### Homepage User Experience

**What Works Well:**

Strong Visual Impact

The banner image immediately reinforces nature and preservation.

Good first impression for a conservation nonprofit.

Hero Section is Clean

The headline + CTA button approach is solid.

But the "Take Action to Protect Wild Places" section could be stronger.

**Where It Falls Short:**

Not Enough Emotional Pull

The homepage doesn’t tell a compelling story.

There's no immediate impact metric (e.g., "We’ve protected X acres of land – and we need your help to do more").

Suggested fix: Lead with a bold, emotional statement and numbers.

Poor Visual Hierarchy

The homepage lacks a clear flow guiding visitors from interest → engagement → action.

Instead of listing information blocks, it should guide users into specific actions.

Navigation Could Be More Intuitive

Important links are buried.

Some key engagement points (volunteering, urgent conservation needs, impact stories) are not prominent.

### Preserves to Explore Section

**Strengths:**

Good Use of Grid Layout

The visual tiles of preserves are effective.

This makes it easy for users to browse options.

Dual Map/List View is Excellent

This is a smart feature that gives users options.

**Weaknesses**:

Descriptions Are Hidden on Hover

This relies too much on user interaction.

Suggested fix: Have a small preview description below each image.

Lack of Filtering

Users can’t filter by:

Accessibility (e.g., wheelchair-friendly)

Difficulty level (easy/moderate/hard)

Type of activity (hiking, birdwatching, photography)

No Personalization

There's no tool to suggest preserves based on user preferences.

Suggested fix: "Find the Right Preserve for You" quiz or filter tool.

### Give Generously (Donation Pages)

**Strengths**:

Includes Multiple Giving Options

Membership, one-time donations, planned giving, stock gifts, etc.

Sponsor Logos for Credibility

Highlighting business sponsors reinforces community support.

**Weaknesses:**

Too Generic & Passive

The donation ask lacks emotional storytelling.

Suggested fix: Use a more compelling CTA:

Current: "Give Generously."

Better: "Save Door County's Wild Places – Donate Today!"

No Urgency

There’s no mention of time-sensitive conservation efforts.

Suggested fix: Add a specific fundraising goal or deadline.

No Social Proof

Would be more effective with donor testimonials or impact metrics.

### News & Outings Section

**Strengths**:

Frequent Updates

The site does a great job of keeping news fresh.

Diverse Content Types

It includes conservation updates, partnerships, and events.

**Weaknesses**:

Too Text-Heavy

The blog-style approach buries the best content.

Suggested fix: Use a grid layout with featured stories.

No Categorization or Tagging

There's no way to filter news by topics.

Suggested fix: Use categories like "Conservation Wins," "Volunteer Spotlights," "Upcoming Events."

### Accessibility & Mobile-Friendliness

**Strengths**:

Clean Layout for Mobile

The structure doesn’t break on mobile screens.

Readable Font Choices

The typography is legible across devices.

**Weaknesses**:

Some Click Targets Are Too Small

Example: Certain buttons and links are too close together on mobile.

Alt Text Missing on Some Images

This reduces accessibility for users with screen readers.
