***"We retired to Door County because we'd had enough 'pavement pounding' and loss of nature in our earlier lives. So when the chance to preserve the canal property occurred, it was a no-brainer - do whatever possible to save this splendid place. Thanks to the Land Trust and many, many dedicated folks, the Ship Canal Nature Preserve has become and will remain a public treasure."***

**- Bill Utley, Preserve Steward and avid hiker**

Volunteer work includes stewarding the land and preparing nature preserves for public use, assisting with events, serving as a representative of the Land Trust at festivals, administrative tasks, and much more.

We are indebted to our volunteers' commitment to protecting Door County's exceptional lands and waters since the Land Trust's founding in 1986.
