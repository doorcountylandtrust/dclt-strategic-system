# :: North Star Metrics + Measurement Philosophy

*A framework to guide how we define, measure, and interpret communications and engagement success across brand, website, and donor experience.*

---

## 🌟 Purpose of This Page

To identify the most meaningful indicators of progress and impact — rooted in mission, not just marketing convention — so we can:

- Make informed, values-aligned decisions
- Prioritize improvements that matter
- Communicate success clearly to internal and external audiences

---

## 🧭 Guiding Principles

1. **Mission-Aligned Over Vanity Metrics**
    - It’s more valuable to deepen trust than to chase clicks.
2. **Lagging + Leading Indicators**
    - We track both final outcomes and early signals of momentum.
3. **Qualitative + Quantitative**
    - Storytelling and metrics reinforce each other.
4. **Comparability Over Time**
    - Metrics should allow for trend analysis, not just snapshots.
