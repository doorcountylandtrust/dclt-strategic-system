# — Whole Communities Framework (Stakeholder Lens)

A framework to help Door County Land Trust understand how different stakeholders relate to land, privilege, and conservation. It supports more inclusive and strategic messaging by identifying gaps in our audience reach and helping us speak meaningfully to diverse priorities.

### Summary of the Four Quadrants:

| Quadrant | Focus | Privilege | Typical Stakeholders | Needs/Motivations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Upper Left | Nature | Privileged | Legacy donors, long-time conservationists, retirees | Land preservation, biodiversity, legacy impact |
| Lower Left | Nature | Less Privileged | Outdoor workers, youth in environmental justice communities | Environmental justice, access to nature |
| Upper Right | People | Privileged | Educators, wellness seekers, cultural orgs | Outdoor education, mental/physical wellness |
| Lower Right | People | Less Privileged | Frontline communities, food-insecure households | Public health, food access, democratic inclusion |

### Messaging Opportunities

| Quadrant | Messaging Tone | Channels | Visuals |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Upper Left | Legacy, gratitude, timelessness | Print newsletters, donor letters | Landscapes, historic milestones |
| Lower Left | Justice, voice, shared stewardship | Community partnerships, bilingual content, direct outreach | Youth, diverse stewards, action shots |
| Upper Right | Wellness, inspiration, balance | Instagram, guided experiences, local media | People enjoying nature, wellness activities |
| Lower Right | Empowerment, inclusion, relevance | Cross-sector partnerships, resource access points | Community photos, real stories |

This helps us ask:

- Where are we over-represented?
- Which voices or communities are absent?
- How can we *co-create* programming or messages that are more relevant across all quadrants?
