# Prospect Survey: Values-Driven Messaging Validation

### **🧭 Purpose**

This page tracks the planning, outreach, and analysis of a public-facing survey designed to test whether a more activist, values-driven messaging strategy resonates beyond our current membership base.

We aim to understand what tone, language, and calls-to-action prospective supporters respond to—before we fully shift our brand voice.

---

## **🎯 Goals**

- Assess alignment between prospect values and bold messaging themes (e.g., stopping sprawl, active defense of land)
- Identify new or latent supporter segments
- Compare tonal preferences across engagement levels
- Ensure any messaging pivot is rooted in data, not assumptions

---

## **🧠 Target Audiences**

- 📧 Constant Contact subscribers (who have not donated)
- 🛒 Event attendees or RSVPs who aren’t yet members
- 💤 Lapsed/inactive past donors
- 🧭 New residents and seasonal visitors (via partner networks)
- 🌿 Civic-minded locals: planners, educators, artists, landowners
