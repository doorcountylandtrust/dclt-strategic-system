# — Storytelling Strategy & Campaign Framework

## **📖 Storytelling Strategy & Campaign Framework**

**Purpose:**

To define DCLT’s storytelling strategy and guide implementation across web, social, email, print, and events. This page captures themes, content types, campaign ideas, and real examples to inspire action and deepen engagement.

---

## **1. Core Storytelling Themes for DCLT**

These themes align with our strategic goals and audience interests:

### **Land & Water Conservation Stories**

- Share before-and-after transformations of protected lands.
- *Example*: Document stewardship efforts (e.g., volunteers restoring a prairie).

### **Personal Stories from Landowners & Community Members**

- Feature a landowner’s decision to place a conservation easement on their property.
- Highlight a local farmer integrating sustainable practices.
- Volunteer or donor impact stories.

### **Indigenous & Historical Land Narratives**

- Showcase the cultural significance of conserved lands.
- Collaborate with Indigenous communities to highlight traditional ecological knowledge.

### **Biodiversity & Wildlife Success Stories**

- Document species returning to restored habitats.
- Highlight a research project tracking the health of local watersheds.

## **2. Types of Storytelling Content**

Different formats to bring our stories to life:

### **Written Stories & Blog Posts**

- *Examples*:
    - “How We Saved (Named Land): The Story of Conservation in Action”
    - “Meet (Volunteer Name): A Steward of Our Lands”

### **Video Storytelling**

- Short impact videos (2–5 minutes) featuring landowners, volunteers, or wildlife restoration.
- Time-lapse footage showing habitat transformation.

### **Visual Storytelling**

- Before/after photo series of conservation efforts.
- Field note slideshows built from volunteer activities.

### **Podcast or Audio Shorts**

- *Voices from the Land* series featuring landowners, ecologists, and community members.

### **Data Storytelling (Infographics & Maps)**

- *Examples*:
    - “5 Years of Impact: A Look at Conservation Growth in Door County”
    - “How Restoration Projects Improved Water Quality”

## **3. Storytelling Examples from Other Organizations**

Here are examples we can learn from as we refine our own storytelling in conservation:

- **Nature Conservancy** – Uses cinematic videos, personal testimonials, and immersive photography to tell emotionally resonant land protection stories.
- **Land Trust Alliance** – Features documentary-style videos about conservation efforts, Indigenous partnerships, and rural landscapes.
- **Rainforest Alliance** – Blends macro conservation impact with compelling visuals and personal narratives from international partners.
- **Trust for Public Land** – Runs social media campaigns like *“Your Park Story,”* where visitors share personal memories from national parks.

These examples help guide how we can structure stories that inspire support and deepen emotional connection to our mission.

## **4. How We Implement This in Our Communications**

To ensure storytelling becomes a consistent part of our communications strategy, we will:

- **Champion Storytelling Features** – Publish at least one major conservation story per quarter.
- **Align with Campaigns** – Tie storytelling to seasonal fundraising and engagement efforts (e.g., Earth Day, year-end giving).
- **Multi-Format Approach** – Use blog posts, videos, infographics, and social media storytelling to reach different audiences.

This helps us inspire action, deepen connection, and make our impact visible and personal.

## **5. Types of Land Stories We Can Tell**

These story formats help us translate place into meaning, and conservation into personal relevance:

### **The History of the Land (Legacy & Connection)**

- Share generational stories from families who’ve stewarded the land.
- Explore Indigenous or settler histories tied to specific landscapes.

### **A Walk Through the Land (Immersive Experience)**

- Describe what a visitor sees, hears, and feels.
- Use sensory language to transport readers or viewers to the preserve.

### **The Land’s Voice (Personification)**

- Write or film from the land’s perspective — “I am the wetland that returned.”
- Use poetic narration or animations for visual storytelling.

### **The Moment of Change (Transformation & Impact)**

- Highlight a turning point: when land was threatened, protected, or restored.
- Connect action to emotional and ecological outcomes.

### **The Invitation (What’s Next)**

- Stories that end in a call to action: to give, visit, or volunteer.
- Emphasize urgency, community belonging, and shared stewardship.

## **Formats & Tools to Tell These Stories**

To bring these stories to life in dynamic and immersive ways, we can use:

1. **Written Stories** – Rich, narrative blog posts or personal essays.
2. **Photo Essays** – Visual storytelling with captions or quotes.
3. **Video Stories** – Short cinematic clips featuring landscape visuals, voiceover, and interviews.
4. **Interactive Maps** – Show conservation progress over time.
5. **Audio Stories & Podcasts** – Volunteers, ecologists, and donors narrating their experiences.
6. **Immersive Walkthroughs** – Guided story experiences through preserves (360°, trail views, etc.)

## **Example Storylines for Us**

These are working titles and concepts to explore in campaigns or donor communications:

- [**“The Land That Speaks”** – An evocative phrase that personifies the land, telling its own story over time.](../../3 REFERENCE & TOOLS 1e52a8cd575580c7a886f4de373f194d/messaging-library/storytelling-campaigns/“The Land Speaks” Campaign Concept 1e52a8cd5755803d837dd36522ad7492.md)
