    `✅ Final – [Page Title]`
    
- **Prefixes for page type:**
    
    `📄 Brief – [Topic]`

## 🔁 Decision-Making Protocol

Use these steps to keep decision records clean and traceable:

1. **Discuss in meetings or async**
2. **Document the decision** on the relevant page (e.g., wireframe, logo direction)
3. **Use this format:**
    
    ```markdown
    ✅ Decision: [What was decided]
    📆 Date: [MM/DD/YYYY]
    🧠 Why: [Rationale, tradeoffs considered]
    👤 Who: [Decision-maker(s) or consensus group]
    ```
