## 2013 Content Buckets — Useful Insights

Historical document can be found at '/Volumes/DCLT/MOD (Membership Outreach Development) Program/Communications and Outreach/Marketing Plan/Content Buckets 2013_05_16.pdf’

### 🧺 **Thematic Buckets to Organize Stories**

These are **6 evergreen content categories** that map directly to mission, values, and donor interests:

1. **Land Conservation** – Preserve spotlights, acquisition stories, protection milestones
2. **Science & Nature** – Ecology explainers, species features, seasonal cycles
3. **Community & Partners** – Volunteer stories, local business allies, community benefits
4. **Organizational Health** – Leadership transparency, board updates, financial integrity
5. **Economic & Public Benefit** – Tourism, wellness, clean water, public access
6. **Door County Culture** – Landowner legacies, regional identity, local voices

These buckets are **still highly usable** as filters or tags for newsletters, social, or website content.

---

### 🗂️ **Story Formats Still Worth Reusing**

- “**Top 5 Hikes for Fall**”–style **lists**
- Short **project updates** (1–3 paragraph snapshots)
- Volunteer/member **spotlights**
- “**By the Numbers**”–style visuals
- **Behind-the-scenes** looks at staff or decisions

---

### 🎯 **Strategic Strengths**

- Anchors all content in clear **audience value**
- Encourages content **variety** (so not every post is a “new preserve”)
- Includes both **mission-facing** (land, science) and **audience-facing** (community, economic) categories

---

### 🔄 What to Modernize

- Language and tone (some is outdated or overly formal)
- Integrate with today’s **engagement goals** (e.g. segmentation, digital CTAs)
- Refresh imagery and tie to **current campaigns** (e.g. climate resilience, equity, visitor experience)

## A Practical Guide to Integrated Communications

Historical document located at '/Volumes/DCLT/MOD (Membership Outreach Development) Program/Communications and Outreach/Marketing Plan/IDEALWARE_INTEGRATEDCOMMUNICATIONS_OCTOBER2013.pdf’

**1. Integrated > Isolated**

- **Main Point**: Single-channel efforts underperform. Multi-channel communications (email, mail, social, phone, events) build stronger relationships and deliver higher donor retention and gift size.
- **Why it matters**: For DCLT, integrating print appeals, social content, and email updates under one campaign umbrella will improve results and reduce message confusion.

**2. Four Content Types Framework**

Useful for categorizing and balancing your messaging:

- **Creating**: Original blog posts, videos, photos, stories.
- **Promoting**: Event invites, donation asks, signups.
- **Community Building**: Thank-yous, engagement questions, volunteer shout-outs.
- **Curating**: Articles or content from conservation peers.

**3. Self-Audit Templates**

- Worksheets walk you through auditing each communication channel by post frequency and message type—**great to adapt into Notion as a recurring audit system**.

**4. Ideal Mix Pie Charts**

- A compelling exercise: compare your actual content mix vs. your ideal. Helps identify imbalance (e.g., too much promotion, not enough community building).
- Could be very useful in your upcoming **“Voice and Messaging Strategy”** section.

**5. Campaign Planning Structure**

Includes worksheets for:

- Goal setting
- Milestone mapping
- Channel use by week
- Flow mapping (e.g., email ➝ landing page ➝ donate)
- Success metrics (followers, engagement, conversions)

**6. Maintenance Strategy (Between Campaigns)**

- Offers practical ideas to keep engagement strong year-round.
- Encourages creative experimentation during off-peak periods, which aligns well with your milestone-based planning approach.

**7. Implementation Section**

- Encourages assigning **ownership of integration**, not just content creation.
- Pushes for **long-term planning across campaigns**, which could support your Notion calendar view or integrated content dashboard.

## “Right-Things, Right-Now” Marketing Plan Template (Nancy Schwartz)

Historical document lives at '/Volumes/DCLT/MOD (Membership Outreach Development) Program/Communications and Outreach/Marketing Plan/Nonprofit-Marketing-Plan-Template.doc’

### 🧭 **1. Audience-First Planning**

- **Only focus on 1–3 priority target groups**: those who are most likely to help *or* most risky to ignore.
- Segment those groups into sub-audiences by values, needs, and habits (e.g., "parents of young kids," "retirees who volunteer").

> ✍️ Tip for DCLT Notion: Use this to justify and structure the segmentation choices you're already making in your "Target Audiences" page.
> 

---

### 📣 **2. Clear, Action-Driven Calls to Action**

List what you *want each segment to actually do*—not just "understand," but actions like:

- Attend a meeting
- Subscribe
- Share their story
- Advocate for policy
- Donate or pledge

---

### 💡 **3. Message Framing: Benefits & Barriers**

For each segment:

- **Benefits** = What’s in it for them?
- **Barriers** = What’s in the way of taking action?

Examples:

- Parents → “Health of their children” = Benefit
- Partners → “Don’t trust us yet” = Barrier

> ✍️ Could become a “Message Matrix” table in Notion, with segments in rows and columns for “Motivators” and “Obstacles.”
> 

---

### 🔧 **4. Best Methods & Tactics**

Match methods to audience habits. Some examples:

- **Volunteers** → Personal invites, appreciation events
- **Partners** → One-pagers + follow-up email
- **Donors** → Message refinement, testimonials, style guide consistency

---

### 📊 **5. Measurement Benchmarks**

Build in metrics like:

- Number of inquiries or volunteer sign-ups
- Email open/click-through rates
- Attendance at events
- Growth in partnerships
- Qualitative feedback or surveys

> ✍️ Recommend starting a “Benchmarks & Metrics” section in your Comms Strategy Notion hub and linking to it from your audience segments.
> 

---

### 🧱 **6. Build & Iterate**

Use a rolling 30/60/90 day plan:

- Identify tasks, assign owners, deadlines
- Reassess monthly: What worked? What needs to change?
