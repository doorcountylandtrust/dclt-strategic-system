## Organizational Values (The “How”)

How we conduct ourselves as we protect Door County’s exceptional lands and waters…forever.

We are ethical. Practice the highest ethical standards in all personal interactions and business practices.

We are committed to making justice, equity, diversity, and compassion core elements in all we do. Our efforts to conserve land and water are inextricably linked to uplifting our community by offering natural spaces in which everyone may experience nature. We acknowledge that our responsibility does not end with this statement but rather begins here. We cannot fully value and respect the land until we fully value and respect one another.

We are respectful. Treat everyone with respect. Value the time and effort of others, including staff, members, volunteers and partners.

We are a collaborative partner. Work in responsible, transparent and trusted partnerships with other private organizations, the community and public institutions.

We are fiscally responsible. Maintain rigorous controls, balanced decision-making, thoughtful financial management and long-term orientation.

We are community-focused. Make decisions that strengthen local communities and economies.

We are a respected employer. Engage employees by investing in their well-being, job satisfaction, professional development and ongoing success.

We are strategic. Prioritize opportunities that contribute most to the overall health and quality of lands and waters.

We are driven by greater understanding. We gather information and scientific research to develop and improve our practices. We compile key data to measure the outcomes of our efforts.  Through analysis and research our work adapts and evolves in response.
