## 🌄 Strategic Communications Goals (2025–2029)

Our communications strategy will:

- **Amplify Land Protection & Stewardship** – Educate the public about conservation efforts, acquisitions, and restoration projects.
- **Increase Community Engagement & Support** – Strengthen outreach to new demographics, volunteers, and donors.
- **Enhance Fundraising & Legacy Giving Communications** – Support major campaigns with compelling storytelling.
- **Strengthen Partnerships & Thought Leadership** – Position DCLT as a key conservation advocate.
- **Champion IDEA (Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, Accessibility)** – Ensure messaging is welcoming, inclusive, and representative of all communities.

📌 *Strategic Note*: Develop a clear editorial calendar and workflow pipeline to support these pillars.

### 🚩 **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

**Goal:** Develop a 5-year communications plan to align messaging, outreach, audience engagement, and analytics with DCLT’s mission of land conservation.

**Focus:** Audience segmentation, storytelling, impact-based fundraising, website redesign, and stewardship messaging.

### 📊 **CORE COMPONENTS**

### [1. **Audience Segmentation**](comms-strategy-master-hub/audience-segmentation-messaging-strategy.md)

- Based on the 2015 Member Survey and current field knowledge.
- Segments include:
    - **Engaged Donor Ella** (65+, legacy giver)
    - **Outdoor Enthusiast Olivia** (active user, not high giver)
    - **Conservation Volunteer Victor** (younger, action-oriented)
    - **Legacy Giver Linda** (planned giving, trust-building)

    - Psychographics, goals, values
    - Preferred channels (print/email vs. social)
    - Calls to action
    - Messaging tone
    - Engagement tactics

### 2. **Whole Communities Framework**

- A 2x2 matrix mapping privilege and focus (Nature vs. People).
- Quadrants:
    - Upper Left (Privileged/Nature): Legacy donors
    - Lower Left (Less Privileged/Nature): EJ groups, outdoor workers
    - Upper Right (Privileged/People): Educators, cultural orgs
    - Lower Right (Less Privileged/People): Frontline communities
- Used to **evaluate equity gaps** in current outreach.

### 3. **Messaging Library**

- Custom database of key phrases and themes by segment.
- Tone ranges from legacy-focused to action-focused.
- Includes:
    - Calls to action (e.g. “Protect Forever”)
    - Emotional storytelling prompts
    - Positioning language (e.g. “We protect Door County’s exceptional lands and waters… forever”)

### 4. **Analytics & Insights**

- Analytics plan drafted (GA4 underutilized).
- Key metrics to implement:
    - Email open rates by persona
    - Event attendance per segment

    - Social engagement by theme

### [5. **Website Redesign (Planned)**](../2 EXECUTION 1e52a8cd5755806b9553cd0f59698dfc/website-strategy-hub.md)

- Moving to headless WordPress w/ Astro frontend.
- Updated site map: streamlined navigation, improved CTA placement.
- Will prioritize SEO for preserves, donor funneling, and impact storytelling.

### 6. **Donor & Engagement Strategy**

- Donor stewardship ladder modeled:
    - Observer → Participant → Donor → Legacy Giver → Evangelist
- April is Earth Month campaign with a 30-second radio spot drafted.
