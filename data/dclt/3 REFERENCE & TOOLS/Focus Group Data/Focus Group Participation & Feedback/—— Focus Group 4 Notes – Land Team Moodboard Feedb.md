## Key Feedback on the Three Concepts

**Concept A** (most favored):

- Described as having a "state parks vibe" that participants liked
- Felt masculine and authoritative with hand-drawn elements
- Reminded them of topographic maps and cartography
- Participants appreciated the serif font for conveying "authority, history, and science"
- Seen as not too much of a departure from current branding
- Concern about a magenta color that didn't fit well

**Concept B** (least favored):

- Described as "beachy" and too soft
- Color palette was hard to see/read, especially for older audiences
- Would struggle with visibility on merchandise and signage
- Felt more "feminine" and commercial ("like buying something")

**Concept C** (mixed reception):

- More approachable and accessible
- Too similar to current brand (not enough of a refresh)
- Dislike of the eagle imagery (seen as overused)
- More "cartoony" and abstract

## Other Key Insights

- **Current logo criticism**: Described as "clip art," outdated, and inconsistent across materials
- **Color preferences**: Green should remain (brown associated with DNR, other colors taken by local organizations)
- **Typography**: Mixed feelings on serif vs. sans-serif fonts
- **Geographic representation**: Shoreline and escarpment are most distinctive Door County features
- **Accessibility concerns**: Emphasized need for designs that work for older audiences
- **Donor considerations**: People don't like change, so updates should be handled carefully

## Consensus

The group generally preferred Concept A for feeling most appropriate to Door County while being professional and authoritative, though they suggested refinements to the color palette.
