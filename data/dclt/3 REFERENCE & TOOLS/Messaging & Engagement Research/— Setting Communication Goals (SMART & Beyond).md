# — Setting Communication Goals (SMART & Beyond)

Historical document lives at '/Volumes/DCLT/MOD (Membership Outreach Development) Program/Communications and Outreach/Marketing Plan/Resource- Setting Communication Plan Goals.docx’

**Use Case:** Internal project management (e.g., website, brand, campaigns), not audience outreach

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Communication Plans are Critical**: Reinforces the need for intentional, systematic communication—clear assignments, check-ins, and decision-making alignment.
- **SMART Goals Framework**:
    - **Specific** – Define who, what, when, where, and why.
    - **Measurable** – Track outcomes via metrics, analytics, CRM, milestones, or subjective feedback.
    - **Attainable** – Align goals with available resources, time, and capabilities.
    - **Relevant** – Ensure goals matter to leadership, staff, and stakeholders.
    - **Time-bound** – Assign deadlines and cadence for deliverables.
- **Beyond SMART**:
    - Unrealistic goals can provoke **breakthrough thinking**.
    - **Ranges** (e.g., high/low targets) work better than fixed numbers for motivation.
    - **Collaborative goal-setting** avoids top-down misalignment and builds trust.
