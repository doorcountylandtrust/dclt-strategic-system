# 2025 Member Survey: Strategic Insights

Date: April 23, 2025
Donations Generated: Insight-only survey
(no direct donations)
Engagement Rate: 16.85% response rate(573 of ~3,400 members)
Lessons Learned: Communications are highly effective among long-term members, but acquisition and first-year retention are weaknesses. Members seek impact-driven updates on land, water, and stewardship. Messaging should segment newcomers vs. loyalists and support stronger onboarding.

### 📊 Quantitative Overview

**Response Rate:** 16.85% (573 responses from ~3,400 contacts)

**Margin of Error:** ±3.73% at 95% confidence level

> ⚠️ Caveat: This sample reflects DCLT’s most engaged members - those who already read, visit, and give. The casually connected or at-risk audiences are likely underrepresented.

### 📊 Key Quantitative Findings

### 1. **Activities in Door County**

- **Top 3 activities (2025):** Hiking, Birdwatching, Sightseeing
- **Notable trend:** Increase in paddle sports and bicycling. Decline in snowmobiling and hunting.
- “Soft adventures” (birding, swimming, paddle sports) are replacing extractive or motorized rec.

### 2. **Tenure in Door County**

- 72% report a family tie to Door County of 25+ years.
- **Insight:** Generational roots are deepening, but new members with <10 years' connection remain a small portion.

### 3. **Visitation to DCLT Preserves**

- 40%+ visit 5+ times per year. Only ~5% have never visited.
- **Takeaway:** Preserves are not symbolic; they are *actively used*.

### 4. **Connections to DCLT**

- Financial support is the most common tie (84% in 2015, ~75% in 2025).
- Decline in event attendance and volunteerism suggests opportunity to re-energize non-donor pathways.

### 5. **Newsletter Topics**

- Top content interests: Land stewardship, science/ecology, land acquisition stories.
- “Substance over sentiment” dominates member preferences.

### 6. **Giving Priority**

- DCLT is in the top 5 for 65%+ of donors, but rarely the #1 priority.

### 7. **Other Giving Categories**

- Environmental orgs are the most commonly supported locally (reinforces strong alignment).
- Secondary interests: Social services, arts, historical preservation.

- **Connection to DCLT Comparison Table**
    
    
    | **Connection Type** | **2025 % (est.)** | **2015 %** |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | I provided financial support | **~84%** | 84.00% |
    | I volunteered my time | **~20%** | 19.86% |
    | I attended social events / outings | **~30%**  | 43.00% |
    | I served on a committee | **~5%** | 6.43% |
    | I donated/sold land | **~6%** | 4.43% |
    | I included a bequest | **~7%** | 5.57% |
    | I am not connected to the Land Trust | **~6%** | 7.29% |
    | Other | **~10%** *(* | 6.14% |
    
    📌 **Insight:** Financial support remains strong and consistent. Declines in event and social engagement suggest a growing reliance on donors over community programming - an opportunity to **diversify engagement pathways** beyond fundraising.
    
    The 2025 data shows that while **financial support is stable** (~84%, matching 2015), there’s been a notable **drop in social event attendance** (~30%, down from 43%), indicating reduced engagement in communal or in-person touchpoints. Meanwhile, **volunteering and legacy giving (bequests)** have held steady or slightly increased, and **direct land contributions** saw a small rise.
    
    The sharp increase in “**Other**” (~10%, up from 6%) may reflect **newer or less-defined engagement types**, or simple misclassification. This suggests a need to clarify and track evolving supporter behaviors.
    
    **Bottom line:** *Core loyalty is strong, but how members connect is shifting. Diversifying non-financial engagement opportunities could reenergize casual supporters and reduce over-reliance on monetary contributions.*

### 🔄 Engagement Funnel (Revised)

| Stage | Status | Insight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reach | ⚠️ Weak | New-member awareness is soft. Most growth is word-of-mouth or incidental. |
| First-Year Join | ⚠️ Fragile | First-year retention is inconsistent. Onboarding lacks depth. |
| Read & Visit | ✅ Strong | Content relevance and preserve use are excellent. |
| Donate & Stay | ✅ Strong | Loyal donors give and stick around. |
| Advocate & Legacy | ✅ Strong | Legacy giving and long-term mission alignment are well-established. |

### 🚀 Communications Manager Takeaway

> “Your communications are working - for the people who already love you. Growth now depends on reaching the unengaged and improving the first-year member experience.”
> 

---

### ✅ Strategic Priorities Going Forward

- Design a **First-Year Member Funnel** (welcome > engagement > renewal).
- Expand **reach** through partnerships, newcomer groups, and targeted acquisition.
- Reinforce content that aligns with member values: **land, water, impact**.
- Segment comms for **long-time loyalists vs. curious newcomers**.
- Keep refining **tone**: stay informative, mission-centered, never promotional.

- 📊 Key Findings by Visitation Frequency
    
    ### 🟢 Frequent Visitors (5+ times/year)
    
    - **Top keywords:** land, water, wildlife, natural, protect, invasive
    - **Sentiment:** Strong ecological focus; deep familiarity with stewardship issues.
    - **Interpretation:** These members are *land literate*. They support restoration, policy, and habitat protection. Communications should reinforce science, progress updates, and ecosystem interdependence.
    
    ### 🟡 Moderate Visitors (2-4 times/year)
    
    - **Top keywords:** land, water, deer, development, endangered
    - **Sentiment:** Concerned and conservation-minded, but influenced by broader public narratives.
    - **Interpretation:** They connect through visible issues (e.g., deer population, sprawl). Communications should emphasize protection of specific landscapes/species and threats they can recognize.
    
    ### 🔵 Low Visitors (Once/year or less)
    
    - **Top keywords:** land, access, beauty, trails
    - **Sentiment:** Motivated by aesthetics, quiet, and land enjoyment.
    - **Interpretation:** Messaging should be about **opportunity** - what's open to explore, experience, and preserve for future use. Storytelling should evoke peace, wonder, and natural access.
    
    ### 🔴 Never Visited a Preserve
    
    - **Top keywords:** water, people, growth, crowding
    - **Sentiment:** Disconnected from DCLT properties but concerned about *Door County as a place*.
    - **Interpretation:** Their concerns are cultural and communal. Frame conservation as protecting *Door County identity*, values, and long-term balance.
    
    ### 🌍 Strategic Applications
    
    | Audience Segment | Focus Messaging On | CTA Style |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Frequent Visitors | Habitat, stewardship, restoration, systems thinking | "Help protect what you know" |
    | Moderate Visitors | Iconic species, threatened areas, development pressure | "Join others to save what matters" |
    | Low Visitors | Access, scenic beauty, quiet places | "Come explore - and protect it" |
    | Non-Visitors | Shared values, legacy, protecting Door's character | "You don’t have to visit to care" |

    ---
    
    🔵 **5 to 9 Years**
    
    - 🔍 **Top keywords:** land, protection, water, habitat
    - 💬 **Sentiment:** Emerging engagement. Language is more general - aligned with mission but less detailed.

    - 💬 **Sentiment:** Deep local awareness with a strong connection to place. Concerns reflect both ecological and community balance.
    - 🧠 **Interpretation:** This group likely includes middle-generation stewards. They are highly engaged and vocal about visible threats to the local character and environment. Messaging should connect preservation to quality of life and generational continuity.
    
    ---
    
    🟣 **50 to 99 Years**
    
    - 🔍 **Top keywords:** land, water, county, natural, development, protect, beauty
    - 💬 **Sentiment:** Strong pride in legacy and concern over change. Language often reflects nostalgia, long-term investment, and a desire for restraint in growth.
    - 🧠 **Interpretation:** Long-timers see themselves as guardians. Communications should honor continuity and legacy, and reinforce that conservation is a tool to preserve what makes Door County “Door County.”
    
    🟤 **100 Years or More**
    
    - 🔍 **Top keywords:** land, water, natural, development, protect

**📊 Key Findings by Residency Duration**

| **Audience Segment (Residency)** | **Focus Messaging On** | **CTA Style** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Long-timers (25+ years) | Legacy, land ethic, generational stewardship | “Protect what we’ve built together” |
| Mid-timers (10-24 years) | Place identity, belonging, visible impact | “Keep this place the way you found it” |
| Newer residents (<10 years) | Discovery, invitation, accessible conservation | “This land is yours to care for, too” |
- **🔑 High-Level Trends:**
    
    
    | **Residency Group** | **Top Priority Patterns** |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Year-Round Residents** | Most likely to rank DCLT among **Top 3 or Top 5**; lowest rates of “not in top 10” |
    | **Half-Time Residents** | Very strong representation in **Top 5**, but fewer consider DCLT a primary priority |
    | **Seasonal Residents** | Spread between **Top 10**, **Top 5**, and **Top 3** - less concentrated giving priority |
    | **Frequent Visitors** | Favor **Top 3** and **Top 10** rankings, fewer top-level commitments |
    | **Occasional Visitors** | Most likely to place DCLT in **Top 10** or lower; giving is present but distributed |
    | **Non-Residents** | Vast majority (75%) say DCLT is **not among their top 10** priorities |
    
    ### **🧠 Key Takeaways:**
    
    - **Local ties correlate with giving priority** - the more time you spend in Door County, the more likely DCLT is a top-tier cause.
    - **Seasonal and half-time residents** show mixed loyalty - strong potential if cultivated more intentionally.
    - **Opportunity**: Occasional visitors and part-timers may be emotionally engaged but see DCLT as a “secondary” cause. Tailored messaging, impact storytelling, or peer influence could elevate commitment.
    - **Strategic Flag**: 75% of non-residents rank DCLT outside their top 10. That’s a red flag for inclusion efforts and donor diversification.
    - 
1. **Testing Opportunities**
    - Example: A/B test new-member onboarding emails that emphasize different CTA styles (“join others” vs. “come explore”).
    - Pilot a “trail story + donor impact” hybrid email for moderate visitors.
2. **Tracking Framework (lightweight)**

| **Initiative** | **Metric** | **Owner** | **Timeline** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Welcome email revamp | Open & renewal rate | Comms | Q2 2025 |
| “You don’t have to visit to care” social ad | CTR, new list signups | Comms/Dev | May-June |
1. **Persona Mapping**
    - We’re already describing behavioral personas (frequent visitors, seasonal residents, etc.).
    - Consider adding 3-5 “lightweight personas” with name, traits, needs, and best-fit messaging.
- 
- “Where do we see gaps between what members care about and what we’re communicating?”
    
    > “How can we tell stories that connect low-visitors emotionally to the mission?”
