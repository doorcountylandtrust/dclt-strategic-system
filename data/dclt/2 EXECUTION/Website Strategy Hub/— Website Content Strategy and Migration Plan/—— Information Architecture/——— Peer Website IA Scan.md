# ——— Peer Website IA Scan

## 🌿 The Nature Conservancy

**Top Nav Labels:**

Where We Work, Our Work, Get Involved, Stories, About Us, Donate

**Subpages (Observed):**

- `/about`
- `/get-involved`
- `/stories`
- `/donate`
- `/our-work`, `/where-we-work`

**Homepage Content Blocks :**

- Hero block with full-width image + headline CTA
- "Why Donate" block with impact stats and benefits
- Global footprint/impact summary block with stats (e.g., acres protected, trees planted)
- Modular impact highlight cards (e.g., “What We’re Doing”)
- Story-driven grid with images + short excerpts
- Membership & partner trust logos
- Newsletter signup module in footer
- Social and accreditation badges

**Notable Features / UX Ideas:**

- CTA density is high but not overwhelming (Donate, Learn More, Join, etc.)
- Hero content varies contextually across pages (e.g., "Who We Are" vs "Donate")
- Reusable stat + CTA modules work well to validate trust across different pages
- Strong use of color-coding and icons to signal section transitions
- Stories aren’t buried—they are used to drive trust and conversion
- Modular content uses a clean card system across site (visually consistent)

**Content Grouping Observations:**

- "Where We Work" = geographic framing
- "Our Work" = programmatic framing
- "Get Involved" = all supporter actions
- "Stories" = cross-cutting content for trust and engagement
- "Donate" = focused action conversion

**Notes for DCLT:**

- Consider separating geographic vs mission framing like “Where We Protect” vs “Our Work”
- CTA pairings with micro-stats (e.g., "Join 2M supporters") create trust + action
- Reusable card modules could drive consistency across Story, Project, or Preserve types
- Global footer is a strong best practice: donation, newsletter, contact, quick links all accessible
- Stat blocks are not just vanity metrics—they tie directly to messaging (e.g., "Trees Planted = Impact")

**Homepage Content Blocks (in observed order):**

- Large hero w/ image, mission statement, donate CTA
- Urgent CTA card (Save the Greater Prairie Chicken)
- Section: "Meet the Birds You’re Saving" (educational + advocacy combo)
- Modular story grid w/ headlines + bird images
- Multi-block “Work You Support” section: icons, infographics, mission themes

**Notable Features / UX Ideas:**

- Interactive bird ID tool
- Rich storytelling + advocacy layering (birds as emotional hook, paired with action CTAs)
- Highly thematic color usage (yellow for CTAs, blue/black for authority)
- Emphasis on **impact storytelling with urgency** (repetition of “now,” countdowns, high-contrast elements)

**Notes for DCLT:**

- Consider **“Get Outside”** or a nature-driven equivalent as a more active nav label than “Explore”
- Modular storytelling and issue-driven banners are effective at mixing engagement and education
- State/regional customization widgets could be a major win for local orgs like DCLT
- Strong use of **recurring urgency CTAs** (donate, sign up, protect birds today) creates momentum
- Design reinforces **mission through visuals** — consistent iconography and bird imagery = symbolic cohesion

## 🌀 Gathering Waters (Wisconsin Land Trust Alliance)

**Top Nav Labels:**

Who We Are, What We Do, Why We Do It

- Featured News section with blog/article previews

- Newsletter signup
- Footer with navigation, grants/affiliation logos, and social links

**Notable Features / UX Ideas:**

- 3-part mission nav (*Who/What/Why*) provides intuitive orientation without jargon
- Emphasis on visual storytelling through textures, hand-drawn elements, and earth tones
- Soft onboarding — “Hello” greeting and friendly entry points replace heavy messaging
- Event listings and news blog feel approachable and updatable
- Vertical side nav (on mobile/alt views) helps retain visibility of key content
- Prominent membership and advocacy CTA blocks help drive conversions gently

**Notes for DCLT:**

- News + events presented as community updates, not formal press — this tone is welcoming
- Impact storytelling is embedded into the layout, not just isolated in blocks
- You could adapt this “Did You Know” style block into your modular content library
- The *Find a Land Trust* CTA could inspire a “Find a Preserve” or “Explore by Region” tool for DCLT

## 🌲The Ridges Sanctuary

- Homepage is **program-first**: events and actions are prioritized over organizational info
- Contact forms placed on both main and subpages (low-friction)
- Clear, minimalist nav with gently unconventional labels (e.g., “Explore” instead of “Visit”)
- Uses **motion and wave motifs** to create rhythm and emotional tone

**Notes for DCLT:**

- Consider event CTA placement *above the fold* if programs are a top draw
- Use colored cards to help segment articles, initiatives, or story types
- Replicate the warmth of the Mission page—consider placing yours in the “About” section but design it to feel inspiring, not bureaucratic
- Clean contact CTAs could replace your current footer form block
- Good model for modular storytelling on a small budget—most of their layout could be adapted into reusable blocks

- Consider integrating timely or seasonal content directly into homepage blocks
