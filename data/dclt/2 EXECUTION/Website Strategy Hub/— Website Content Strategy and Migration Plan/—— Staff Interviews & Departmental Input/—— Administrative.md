# —— Administrative

## **📝 Interview Summary – Admin/Operations-Oriented Stakeholder**

### **Website Strengths Identified**

- **Homepage updates feel more timely**—appreciated improvement.
- **Cross-media alignment works well**—e.g., Annual Gathering messaging appears consistently across channels.
- Staff rely on the site to **pull information when fielding calls**.

---

### **Issues and Opportunities**

### **⚠️ Forms & Salesforce Integration**

- Current forms (especially **volunteer, contact, and map requests**) are clunky and disconnected from Salesforce.
- Needs:
    - Autofill submissions **directly into Salesforce**
    - Matching **field labels** and structure to reduce manual entry
    - Map requests should **autofill into a reportable format** (e.g., for address labels)

### **🧭 UX & Clarity Gaps**

- **Address confusion**: People are unsure which address to use (street vs PO box vs seasonal).
- **Hunting Program page**:
    - Lacks obvious staff contact info
    - Options aren’t clear
    - Poor triage → wrong staff getting emails
- **Donate Now vs Renew**:
    - Users trying to “Renew” click “Donate Now” and get confused.
    - Needs **a clearer Membership CTA** or labeled button (esp. on homepage).
- **Preserve vs Natural Area confusion**:
    - Public doesn’t understand difference
    - People accidentally hike non-preserve lands
- **Event registration navigation**:
    - People often can’t find events or registration info
- **Publications page**:
    - Needs to be kept current

### **📱 Media Integration Suggestions**

- Embed **social media content** on the website for visibility and freshness
- Include **links or info to AllTrails** or other hiking map platforms
- Each Preserve page could feature **navigation options and access info**

### **🧠 Staff Enablement & Consistency**

- Suggests:
    - A **unified cheat sheet or “elevator script”** for land acquisition vs conservation easements
    - Better FAQs or quick-reference info for front-line staff
    - Consistency in language around taxes, ownership, and access

---

### **🎯 Website Section Goals**

- Make it **easy and intuitive** for visitors to:
    - Donate or renew
    - Contact the right person
    - Find events and register
    - Access clear, field-friendly preserve info
- Align input fields with **Salesforce field structure** (e.g., cell vs landline, name formats)
- Improve digital workflows to **minimize staff bottlenecks**

---

## **🔍 Thematic Analysis**

| **Theme** | **Insight** |
| --- | --- |
| **System integration gap** | Forms aren’t syncing with Salesforce, causing admin friction and lost insights |
| **Public confusion persists** | Address info, land access rules, and CTAs (like “Renew”) need clarity |
| **Poor UX is creating calls and frustration** | Especially around the Hunting Program, event registration, and CE vs land acquisition differences |
| **Digital content can boost field engagement** | AllTrails, embedded maps, and mobile-friendly preserve data could bridge access barriers |
| **Staff need tools to speak consistently** | Front-line staff benefit from shared language, definitions, and answers for common questions |

| 🟡 Medium | Create a **staff-facing cheat sheet or “Comms Toolkit”** | Include elevator pitch, CE vs acquisition distinctions, common myths |
| 🟡 Medium | Embed **social and AllTrails content** into Preserve pages | Use Groundswell Conservancy map or similar as an inspiration |
