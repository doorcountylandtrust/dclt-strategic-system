## Process Summary

### 1. Shared Foundation

- Review **Values & Keywords** together.
- Agree on fixed elements vs. open creative space.
- Align on what success looks like before designing.

### 2. Concept Ownership

- **Round 1**: Each designer produces **two distinct concepts**.
- Concepts can share core elements but should differ in creative approach, tone, and/or symbol set.

### 3. Concept Depth (Round 1)

For each concept, include:

- Primary logo mark
- Suggested wordmark treatment
- 2–3 mockups in key contexts (signage, social media, merchandise)
- 2–3 sentence description of concept intent
- **Optional brand expression elements**: One or two supporting pieces (e.g., simple icon, ornamental linework, illustrative style sample, or website hero mockup) that reinforce the concept’s tone and adaptability.
- *Note*: Skip full color system or final typography at this stage.

### 4. Review Cadence

- Present all Round 1 concepts together.
- Use the [[— Logo & Visual Identity Evaluation Roadmap|**rubric**]] for scoring.
- Discuss and shortlist 1–2 concepts for refinement.

### 5. Refinement Phase

For shortlisted concepts:

- Finalize typography
- Develop full color palette
- Test applications across digital, print, and physical signage
- Update mockups to final fidelity

### 6. Inclusion & Voice

- Each designer presents their own work.
- Credit contributions clearly in updates. but end product is a “we” accomplishment
- Allow each designer to propose one exploration area or “wild card” idea.
