# 📓 Field Notes

A storytelling-forward series that brings readers into the field—through the eyes of staff, volunteers, or donors.

**Purpose**: Showcase our people, process, and passion for place. Less formal than news—more about presence and personality.

**Good For**:

- Social posts (photo + short caption)
- Mid-month emails or PS sections
- Print newsletters
- Behind-the-scenes reels

---

## 🧠 Strategy Notes

- Capture voice: use quotes, casual tone, or direct speech.
- Pair with strong candid photos or short field videos.
- Reinforce stewardship, community, and transparency.
- Tap seasonal routines (e.g., prescribed burns, cleanup days).
- Consider archetype appeal (e.g. “Volunteer Victor,” “Legacy Ella”)
