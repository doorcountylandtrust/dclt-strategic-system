# —— Land Project Manager

## **📝 Interview Summary – Land Project Manager**

### **Website Feedback & Structural Issues**

- **Content density & discoverability issues:**
    - **Land Protection text is too long**—eyes glaze over.
    - **Conservation Easement section is buried** and lacks a clear entry point.
    - The **Land Inquiry Form is too hidden**—should be its own prominent button.
    - Suggested structure: a **“Ways to Protect Your Land” page** with clear buttons:
        - Donate Land
        - Establish a Conservation Easement
        - Sell Land to DCLT
- **Navigation & hierarchy improvements:**
    - Dropdown under **“How We Save Land”** is unintuitive.
        - Reorder: 1) Protect Your Land, 2) Caring for the Land, 3) Hunting Program, 4) Blog (which deserves its own space).
    - **Hunting Program is widely used** but hard to find and poorly laid out.
        - Maps are the most valued content; the page is confusing.
        - Wants user tracking data (e.g., map clicks, form submissions) for grants and storytelling.
- **Stewardship content is underdeveloped:**
    - “Caring for the Land” should actually **describe stewardship work**, but it doesn’t get updated and lacks real substance.
- **“Resources and Links” page is outdated:**
    - Needs more on **invasive species management and native planting**.
    - Suggests a **seasonal landowner calendar**: e.g., “Time to pull garlic mustard,” “Cut back honeysuckle in March,” etc.

---

### **Messaging & Education Goals**

- **Website should:**
    1. Clearly teach how DCLT can help landowners protect their land.
    2. Empower landowners to **see their land as connected to a broader ecosystem**.
    3. Dispel misconceptions about Conservation Easements and hunting access.
- **Common misconceptions heard:**
    - CE = land becomes public (false).
    - DCLT ownership = no hunting (also false).
    - Land trust work removes properties from the tax roll or causes property value issues.
    - Local zoning makes DCLT’s work unnecessary.
- **Needs support countering skepticism:**
    - Doesn’t know how to tackle these beliefs but suggests they could be addressed through **fact-infused comms content**.

---

### **Audience and Use Cases**

- **Primary audience:** Landowners
    - Many want to “do the right thing” but need **simple, practical, credible info**.
    - Should feel like DCLT is a **partner**, not an institution talking down to them.
- **Print material and cross-channel use:**
    - Created a **tri-fold CE brochure** that could be refreshed with the rebrand and made official.
- **Update frequency needs:**
    - Personally doesn’t need regular access but notes that **hunting content must be updated annually**—and it’s always a pain.

## **🔍 Thematic Analysis**

| **Theme** | **Insight** |
| --- | --- |
| **Poor UX hierarchy** | Important actions and info are buried under long text and unclear menus. Navigation needs reordering and simplification. |
| **Form + CTA placement** | Critical actions (like Land Inquiry or CE contact) are too hidden—should be surfaced clearly as **primary buttons or links**. |
| **Content gaps for landowners** | There’s demand for **seasonal, plain-language guidance** to help people manage their land better—not just protect it. |
| **Persistent public misconceptions** | CE misunderstandings and skepticism about land protection threaten trust. These must be addressed proactively in comms. |
| **High-value pages lack measurement** | Pages like “Hunting Program” are widely used but offer no insight into user behavior—this is a missed opportunity for **analytics-driven grant reporting**. |
| **Desire for communication tools** | Wants polished, branded outreach tools like updated CE brochures for landowner engagement. |

## **✅ Key Opportunities**

| **Priority** | **Opportunity** | **Recommendation** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🔴 High | Restructure **“How We Save Land”** menu & landing pages | Create a “**Ways to Protect Your Land**” hub with 3 primary buttons (Donate / Easement / Sell). Reorder dropdown for intuitive access. |
| 🔴 High | Make the **Land Inquiry Form** a prominent CTA | Place above-the-fold on key pages, clearly labeled, in button format. |
| 🔴 High | Simplify and optimize the **Hunting Program page** | Use visual CTAs for maps, add a short FAQ, and implement basic tracking for clicks and form use. |
| 🟡 Medium | Create a **seasonal landowner calendar** or “What to Do This Month” feature | Simple, practical tips for invasive species control, planting, monitoring. Publish as a recurring blog or page element. |
| 🟡 Medium | Develop **myth-busting content blocks** | Use newsletters, web pages, or social posts to **dispel key misconceptions** with confidence and tact. |
| 🟡 Medium | Revise and relaunch the **CE tri-fold brochure** | Align with rebrand, ensure it’s visually strong, and upload a digital version to the website. |
| 🟢 Low | Add analytics to **high-use pages** | Even basic tools (e.g., UTM codes, click counts on map links, form views) would support grantwriting and internal learning. |
