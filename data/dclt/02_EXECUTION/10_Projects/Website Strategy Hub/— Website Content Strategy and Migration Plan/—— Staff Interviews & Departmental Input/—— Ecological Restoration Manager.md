# —— Ecological Restoration Manager

## **📝 Interview Summary – Ecological Restoration Manager**

### **Website Feedback & Use Cases**

- **Hunting-related information is confusing:**
    - The **hunting form is hard to find**—users don’t notice the orange oval icon.
    - **Hunting area maps/table** could be improved:
        - Use a **sticky top row** in tables for clarity.
        - Consider **internal vs. public use**—some maps/tools may be best kept behind the scenes.
- **GIS/Tax parcel visibility:**
    - **Tax parcel boundaries should be buried**—they can overwhelm or confuse users.
    - Be mindful of how much GIS-level info is shown to the public.
- **Accessibility & inclusion considerations:**
    - Open to **residents giving input** about accessibility features—unsure if this is an unmet need, but it should be explored.
    - Trail cameras or **time-lapse photos** could offer virtual nature access for those who cannot physically visit.
- **Landowner outreach role:**
    - Sees DCLT as a **potential hub for landowner support**:
        - Connecting landowners to **experts, best practices, agencies (like US Forest Service)**.
        - Website could empower people to **better manage their land** through resource sharing.

### **Communications & Strategic Needs**

- **Clarity in public-use tools and forms:**
    - Simplify access to **hunting permissions and maps**.
    - Consider a **dedicated “Hunting on DCLT Lands” page** that’s easy to find, clearly written, and visually clean.
- **Accessible experiences for remote users:**
    - Explore creative content like **trail cams**, **seasonal time-lapse**, or **“virtual hike” experiences** for those homebound or geographically distant.
- **Position DCLT as a connector and resource hub:**
    - Provide curated **how-to content, expert contacts, or links** for landowners.
    - Act as a **knowledge center**, not just a conservation organization.

## **🔍 Thematic Analysis**

| **Theme** | **Insight** |
| --- | --- |
| **Poor discoverability** | Current UI (e.g. hunting form) relies too much on iconography or obscure placements—needs better structure and cues. |
| **Public vs Internal Use** | Some GIS or map tools are best for staff; exposing them publicly can cause confusion or friction. |
| **Resource Hub Potential** | DCLT could expand its role as a **trusted connector** for conservation-minded landowners. |
| **Inclusive Nature Access** | Trail cams and remote experiences could expand DCLT’s mission reach to **people with limited mobility or distant supporters**. |
| **Unvalidated Needs** | Accessibility gaps should be confirmed with **community feedback**, not assumed. |

## **✅ Key Opportunities**

| **Priority** | **Opportunity** | **Recommendation** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🔴 High | Redesign or consolidate **Hunting Information** into a single clear page | Include permission form, updated maps, and FAQs. Use clear CTA buttons instead of obscure icons. |
| 🟡 Medium | Add **virtual nature experiences** (trail cams, time-lapse photos, seasonal snapshots) | Expand your mission reach to those who can’t hike preserves—this aligns with inclusion and engagement goals. |
| 🟡 Medium | Begin scoping a **Landowner Resource Hub** | Curate and centralize tools, agency connections, conservation guides. Position DCLT as a bridge between landowners and expertise. |
| 🟢 Low | Solicit **community feedback on accessibility** needs | Start with a one-question pulse survey or informal outreach—see what people *actually* want. |
| 🟢 Low | Hide or obfuscate **GIS-heavy or tax parcel layers** for public users | Limit to internal staff tools unless contextually necessary on public maps. |
