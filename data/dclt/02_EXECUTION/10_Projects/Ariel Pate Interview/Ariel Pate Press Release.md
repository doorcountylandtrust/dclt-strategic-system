Preserving the Magic: A Daughter’s Gift Becomes a Legacy of Protection

As a child, Ariel Pate would occasionally visit her family’s wooded 40-acre property in northern Door County with her father, Fritz Renner—but each time felt magical. “It always felt slightly mystical,” she recalls. Nestled between Whitefish Bay and Clark Lake, the land quietly held a vernal stream and thick stands of trees that seemed to whisper their own story.

Now, Ariel has ensured that story will continue. By donating the land to Door County Land Trust in memory of her father, a lifelong conservationist, she has added a powerful new chapter to her family’s legacy of stewardship.

The decision came into focus when she studied satellite maps and saw just how unique the property was. Her family’s parcel sat quietly within a much larger stretch of undeveloped forest, a rare remnant in the heart of the peninsula. “Because of a whole host of factors, it’s been mostly left alone,” she said. As she returned over time, walking the land in different seasons, she noticed how the trees had matured and how certain plants had adapted around the spring-fed stream. What began as a personal act of remembrance became something more: a chance to protect a rare, living corridor of wild land.

“It was an opportunity to preserve a large area that couldn’t be accomplished by simply keeping the acreage as private property,” she said. With each walk—through snowmelt, spring bloom, and autumn hush—the land revealed more of itself. The vernal stream curved through the forest floor. Ferns pushed through damp soil. Native plants settled into patterns of light, water, and resilience. “The trees there are truly beautiful,” Ariel said. “My family and I have enjoyed hiking through it at different times of year, observing the ways different plants have grown in particular ways.”

For Ariel, donating the land was about more than protecting habitat. It was a way to honor her father’s values and extend them into the future. “I hope people can experience a connection to place,” she said, “and an appreciation for how nature recovers and adapts.” She imagines future visitors walking those same quiet trails, noticing the light through the trees, the hush of the stream, the way wild spaces invite reflection. In giving this land to the Land Trust, she’s ensured that the feeling she once had—a sense of something slightly mystical, just off the beaten path—will still be waiting for those who seek it.

This protected 40-acre property includes mature upland forest, nine acres of wetland, and a tributary of the West Branch of Whitefish Bay Creek—features that support a diversity of native plant and animal species. Rolling glacial moraine formations and existing two-track paths wind through the woods, creating potential for future hiking opportunities. Together, these natural features form a rare, contiguous stretch of riparian habitat, part of the larger Whitefish Bay watershed. The protection of this parcel enhances the ecological corridor surrounding Door County Land Trust’s nearby Oak Road Nature Preserve and strengthens ongoing efforts to safeguard the region’s clean water, intact forests, and wildlife movement.
