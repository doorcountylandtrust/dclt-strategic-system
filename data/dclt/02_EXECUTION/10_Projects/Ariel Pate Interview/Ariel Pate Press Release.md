As a child, Ariel Pate visited the wooded 40-acre property with her father occasionally, but each time felt magical. “It always felt slightly mystical,” she recalls. Nestled between Whitefish Bay and Clark Lake, the land quietly held a vernal stream and thick stands of trees that seemed to whisper their own story. Now, as an adult, Ariel has ensured that story will continue, by donating the land to Door County Land Trust in memory of her father, Fritz Renner—a lifelong conservationist—she has added a powerful chapter to the family’s legacy of stewardship.
That decision came into focus when Ariel studied satellite maps of northern Door County. Her family’s 40-acre parcel sat quietly within a much large stretch of undeveloped forest, a rare remnant in the heart of the peninsula. “Due to a whole host of factors, it’s been mostly left alone,” she said. The more she walked the land in different seasons, the more she saw how the trees had matured, and how certain plants had adapted around the spring-fed stream. What started as a personal act of remembrance because something more: a chance to protect a thriving corridor of wild land for generations to come.
As Ariel reflected on the future of the land, the decision to donate it felt both personal and urgent. “It was an opportunity to preserve a large area that couldn’t be accomplished by simply keeping the acreage as private property,” she said.  The more she walked its trails, watching how the landscape changed with the seasons, the more it became clear that this place was part of something larger—a vital piece of the peninsula’s remaining wilderness. Her gift ensured that this forest, with all its quiet complexity, would remain protected for generations to come.
Each visit revealed something new: the curve of the vernal stream after snowmelt, the hush of ferns pushing through the damp soil, the patterns of plants adapting to water and shade. “The trees there are truly beautiful,” Ariel said. “My family and I have enjoyed hiking through it at different times of year, observing the ways different plants have grown in particular ways.” These quiet patterns of resilience deepened her resolve. Protecting the land now meant giving those natural rhythms a chance to continue without interruption, or intrusion.
For Ariel, the act of donating the land was about more than preserving trees or protecting habitat—it was about honoring a legacy and extending it forward. “I hope people can experience a connection to place,” she said, “and appreciation for how nature recovers and adapts.” She imagines future visitors walking those same quite trails, noticing the light through the trees, the hush of the stream, the way wild spaces invite reflection. In giving this land to the Land Trust, she’s ensured that the feeling she one had, a sense of something slightly mystical, just off the beaten path, will still be waiting for those who seek it.
The 40-acre property includes mature upland forest, nine acres of wetland, and a tributary of the West Branch of Whitefish Bay Creek—features that support a diversity of native plant and animal species. Rolling glacial moraine formations and existing two-track paths wind through the woods, creating potential for future hiking opportunities. Together, these natural features form a rare, contiguous stretch of riparian habitat, part of the larger Whitefish Bay watershed. The protection of this parcel adds to the ecological corridor surrounding Door County Land Trust’s nearby Oak Road Nature Preserve and strengthens ongoing efforts to safeguard the region’s clean water, intact forests, and wildlife movement.
