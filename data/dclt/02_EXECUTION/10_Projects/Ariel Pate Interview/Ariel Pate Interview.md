## Answers
1. What does this land mean to you personally?

I visited the land with my father several times as a kid, and it always felt slightly mystical, since it was off the beaten path and our visits were sporadic. As an adult, I’ve come to appreciate how unique it is, since it has a vernal stream running through it that feeds into Whitefish Bay and Clark Lake.

2. What inspired you to donate it in memory of your father?

My dad, Fritz Renner, was passionate about conservation and preservation, and he was a long-time member of the Door County Environmental Council. He and my aunt stewarded the property for many years, with the help of Ryan Kiehnau, who hunted on it. After my dad’s passing in 2009, I’ve always sought out ways to remember him that were connected to nature, and this donation seemed like a logical extension of that.   

3. What do you hope people feel or experience on this land in the future?

I hope people can experience a connection to place, and appreciation for how nature recovers and adapts. I hope they feel inspired to support the continued preservation of natural areas, either through direct donations, or by advocating for the robust funding of programs like the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship program.

4. Was there a moment—or feeling—that helped you know this gift was the right decision?

When I first considered donating, I looked at the satellite maps of Northern Door, and noticed that this acreage is in a large area of undeveloped land in the middle of the peninsula. Due to a whole host of factors, it’s been mostly left alone. The trees there are truly beautiful, and my family and I have enjoyed hiking through it at different times of year, observing the ways different plants have grown in particular ways. It felt important to make sure the land remained undeveloped. When I heard from the Lutsey family **(Don, please check with them about if that mention is OK)** about their neighboring property coming up for sale, it seemed like that by donating this parcel to the Land Trust, and alerting the Land Trust to the opportunity to purchase the Lutsey's property, it was an opportunity to preserve a large swath of land, that couldn’t be accomplished by simply keeping the acreage as private property.
