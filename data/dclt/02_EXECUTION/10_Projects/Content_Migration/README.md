# Content Migration Directory

This folder contains legacy copy, rewrite drafts, and audience/CTA mapping notes for all primary website content.

## Workflow
1. Save a clean copy of the legacy content
2. Annotate with notes (tone, structure, audience mismatch)
3. Draft modular rewrite (using blocks, CTAs, updated voice)
4. Tag rewrites by segment (persona, funnel stage, CTA)
5. Link drafts to dev files or templates when ready
