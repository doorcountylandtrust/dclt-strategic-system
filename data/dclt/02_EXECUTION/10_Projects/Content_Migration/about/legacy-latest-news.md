Notes

	•	It lacked a formal introduction, purpose statement, or filters beyond static categories.
	•	Stories were not tagged by persona, conservation priority, or campaign alignment.

Implications for Redesign
	•	Content should be restructured as a modular news archive with smart filters and editorial strategy.
	•	Sidebar widgets can become CTA blocks or filters.
	•	Categories should be normalized and tied to broader messaging architecture.
	•	Consider adding featured stories, campaign tie-ins, and shareability enhancements.
