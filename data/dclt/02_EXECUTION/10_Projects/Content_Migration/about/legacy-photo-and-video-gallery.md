	•	Current gallery lacks metadata, titles, or descriptive UX

⸻

Migration Recommendations

Short-Term (MVP):
	•	Archive this page as a “Legacy Media Gallery”
	•	Migrate videos to contextual pages (e.g. education, preserves, donor impact)
	•	Preserve static photo archive, but add alt text, date, and preserve name if possible

Long-Term (Aspirational):
	•	Build a modular Media Block system (photo grid, video embed, caption, category)
	•	Integrate media into new page layouts (Preserve Explorer, campaigns, volunteer hub)
	•	Consider Vimeo playlist curation or switching to self-hosted lightweight video player
	•	Explore modern gallery systems (e.g. PhotoSwipe, custom React component, or block plugin)
	•	Replace PDF newsletters with interactive publication reader or modular post tagging

⸻

Tagging Suggestion

Consider applying future tags such as:
	•	media-type:video, media-type:photo
	•	topic:preserve, topic:education, topic:membership
	•	format:archived, format:legacy, format:embed
