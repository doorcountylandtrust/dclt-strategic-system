### Creative Direction – Door County Land Trust Rebrand (Working Draft)

**Purpose**

To create a brand identity for *Door County Land Trust* that is rooted in place, rich in character, and built to endure—visually expressing the trust, care, and beauty behind our work, while inspiring deeper community connection and broader modern appeal.

---

**Core Design Principles**

**1. Rooted, Not Rustic**

The brand should feel born of the Door Peninsula—shaped by its forests, shorelines, and conservation legacy—not borrowed from generic nature branding.

→ Use place-specific flora/fauna and visual motifs.

→ Avoid overused icons like generic trees, leaves, or mountains.

**2. Textured but Sharp**

We embrace hand-drawn and woodcut styles to evoke craft and care—but the mark must also be clean enough for modern use.

→ Texture supports tone; clarity supports usability.

→ SVG fidelity and high contrast are essential.

**3. Elevated, Not Elitist**

The identity should reflect the seriousness and legacy of the work—without becoming inaccessible, overly minimalist, or academic.

→ Think *natural heritage meets modern stewardship.*

→ Typography should feel editorial, not ornamental.

**4. System-Ready**

This is not just a logo—it’s a flexible brand system.

→ Scalable variants (horizontal, stacked, icon-only).

→ Palette and illustration elements should support signage, merch, events, and digital.

**5. Dual Audience Fluent**

The brand must resonate with:

- **Community**: Residents, members, volunteers, Door County supporters
- **Design World**: Funders, partners, and peers who expect professional, refined visual language
    
    → We aim to impress both, without alienating either.

**Visual Anchors**

Inspiration: Vintage park signage, field guides, editorial illustration, woodcut prints

Avoid: Generic vectors, ultra-flat minimalism, cutesy wildlife

**Success Looks Like:**

A brand that a Door County resident wants on their hat *and* a modern designer wants to save to their inspiration folder.

A system that elevates DCLT’s perception and powerfully serves its mission.
