---\n\n# —— Symbolism System

This document outlines the symbolic meaning behind each core visual element used in the Door County Land Trust brand system. These elements were chosen not only for their aesthetic quality but also for their alignment with the organization’s mission, values, and brand archetypes: Caregiver, Explorer, and (in moments of activation) Hero.
