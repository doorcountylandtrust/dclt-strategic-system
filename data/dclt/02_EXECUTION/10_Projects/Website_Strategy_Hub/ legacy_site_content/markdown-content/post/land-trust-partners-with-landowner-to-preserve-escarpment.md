<strong>Door County, WI –</strong> The Niagara Escarpment is an epic, ancient geological formation that arcs from Illinois to Ontario, skirting the edges of Lake Michigan and Huron and serving as the foundation of the Door Peninsula. This dolomitic limestone ridge – an ancient coral reef from a time when Wisconsin sat near the equator – has been carved over thousands of years by differential erosion and glacial action. Near its eastern terminus, Niagara Falls spills over this ridge, giving the geological feature its name. 466 miles of the escarpment in Ontario have been deemed a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, containing the oldest forest ecosystem and most ancient old-growth forests in North America.

&nbsp;

Door County’s escarpment gives rise to dramatic 100-foot bluffs and sheltered beaches lined with tumbled stones and fine sands. This unique landscape supports rare ecosystems and sensitive species such as bats, tree frogs, and salamanders—as well as species found nowhere else, like the Ice Age–era land snail. The escarpment’s varied topography creates a rich mosaic of habitats, making Door County one of the most biodiverse regions in the Midwest.

&nbsp;

Conserving significant sections of the escarpment began over 100 years ago, when Peninsula State Park was established and thousands of acres – including the bluffs and caves that tower over Eagle Harbor – were preserved. In 1943, Cave Point was preserved as a public park and is arguably the most iconic natural landscape in the county today. Ellison Bluff County Park was established in 1950, with the Door County Parks Board proclaiming, “the limestone headlands, as they emerge out of the blue waters of Green Bay, are geologically one of the most outstanding natural monuments in our country. They must be preserved.”

&nbsp;

These visionary conservation efforts inspire the mission of the Door County Land Trust (Land Trust) today, as the organization works to protect as much of the peninsula as possible before its unique geology, rare species, and rural culture are lost to development. Today, preserving large stretches of bluffland is only possible through the conservation efforts of private landowners, as much of it has already been subdivided and developed into scenic private properties.

&nbsp;

Landowners who want to ensure their property is not developed by future heirs or owners can establish a conservation easement with the Land Trust. This agreement allows them to retain private ownership while the Land Trust ensures permanent guardianship of the land, protecting it from future development and potential ecological damage. Ellison Bay landowner Jim Gearen recently established a conservation easement on 31 acres, taking advantage of this valuable conservation tool.

<strong>Local Landowner Teams Up with Land Trust </strong>

&nbsp;

Gearen’s property features 100-foot limestone bluffs and borders Ellison Bluff County Park. The Land Trust was thrilled to accept this easement, as it expands an important wildlife corridor—enhancing the protected area around the park where animals can move safely and find shelter, food, and mates. Gearen’s parcel also contains Green Bay shoreline and mature mesic forest, a mix of large hemlock, red oak, paper birch, white cedar, white pine, and sugar maple trees. The quality of the woodland, and its location along the shoreline, make this property abundant with birds like black-throated green and black-and-white warblers, red bellied woodpeckers, chipping sparrows, and ovenbirds. Spring ephemerals bloom in the woodland, including trillium and wood anemone.

&nbsp;

<strong>Reaching a Milestone with the Help of Landowners</strong>

&nbsp;

Gearen’s conservation easement was finalized just one week before Earth Day, pushing Door County Land Trust’s total protected acreage past 10,000—a major milestone for the organization. With this achievement, the Land Trust becomes the largest land protection entity in Door County, conserving more land than all five of the county’s state parks combined. Notably, almost 40% of the Land Trust’s protected lands are conserved through easements, highlighting the vital role local landowners play in preserving Door County’s natural heritage.

&nbsp;

While cycling along a favorite nearby road, Jim Gearen often reflects on the people who planted the now-towering trees that form the canopy overhead. The unbroken arch of foliage is especially breathtaking in the fall. He knows that those who planted the trees likely never lived to see them in their full glory. That same spirit of foresight inspired Gearen to conserve his own land. Reflecting on his decision, he shared a quote that guided him: “A society grows great when old men plant trees in whose shade they know they shall never sit.”
