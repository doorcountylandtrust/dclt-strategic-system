<span style="font-size: 14pt;">The native tree and plant give-away is a part of The Big Plant coordinated by the Climate Change Coalition of Door County. It is typically held each year around Earth Day on April 22 and several weekends following. Dates for 2023 events are not yet determined.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Through organizations partnering on The Big Plant, more than 15,000 trees were planted in 2022.  Door County Land Trust chose to include pollinator-friendly perennial plants in their give-away so those with small properties or apartments would also be able to participate.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">“Whether you have a planter on a porch, a small backyard or several acres, you can plant something that helps native insects, birds and wildlife,” says Door County Land Trust director of charitable giving Cinnamon Rossman. “As these trees grow and flowers bloom, they’ll be a reminder of the things we can do to preserve and improve our environment.”</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Tree and plant selections for 2023 will be announced in spring 2023. The 2022 selection of trees included, </span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Northern White Cedar, </span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Balsam Fir, </span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Red Pine, </span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">White Pine, and </span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">White Spruce</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">. The selection of perennial plants included </span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Dogtooth Daisy <em>(Helenium autumnale), </em></span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Prairie Blazing Star <em>(Liatris pycnostachya), </em></span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Common ironweed <em>(Vernonia fasciculata), </em>and </span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Blue/Woodland Phlox (<em>Phlox divaricata</em>)</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">. Each of these plants and trees is hardy in Door County and is beneficial to insects, birds and wildlife. </span>
