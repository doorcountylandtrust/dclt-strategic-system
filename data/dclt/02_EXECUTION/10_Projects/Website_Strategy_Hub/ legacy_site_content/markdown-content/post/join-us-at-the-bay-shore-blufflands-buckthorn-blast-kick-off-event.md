You are invited to join us for a community gathering to kick-off the <em><strong>Bay Shore Blufflands Buckthorn Blast</strong></em> project September 1, 9:30-11:30 a.m.! Learn about the invasive species and unique ecology of the Bay Shore Blufflands Nature Preserve. Take a hike with staff experts and meet stewardship volunteers committed to the <em><strong>Buckthorn Blast</strong></em>. Sign up for future stewardship and hands-on educational events. You'll take home resources and knowledge that you can use on your own property.

Funding for this project is provided by the Bay Shore Property Owners Association and Door County Land Trust with a Land Trust Excellence &amp; Advancement Partnership (LEAP) grant from the Land Trust Alliance and Gathering Waters.
