<em>We are continuing our efforts to control Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris) at Three Springs Nature Preserve on <strong>Tuesday, October 24<sup>th</sup> from 12:30-3:30pm</strong>. Scots Pine is a non-native pine tree that grows more aggressively than other species. This allows Scots Pine to crowd out other trees and prevents desirable native species from growing. More information can be found here <a href="https://www.na.fs.fed.us/fhp/invasive_plants/weeds/scots-pine.pdf">https://www.na.fs.fed.us/fhp/invasive_plants/weeds/scots-pine.pdf</a>.</em>

<em>Please meet in the Three Springs parking area located at 10442 Three Springs Road at 12:30 pm. We will need help cutting seedling Scots Pine using loppers and help piling the larger Scots Pine after it is cut using chainsaws. Reminder - you must be chainsaw trained and demonstrate safe practices in order to operate your chainsaw. Please RSVP to <a href="mailto:volunteer@doorcountylandtrust.org">volunteer@doorcountylandtrust.org</a> if you are able to join us or have questions. </em>
