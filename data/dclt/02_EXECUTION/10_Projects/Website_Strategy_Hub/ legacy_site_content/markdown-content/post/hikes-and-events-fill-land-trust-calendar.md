<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Learn, appreciate, and support nature through hikes and special happenings planned by the Land Trust. Fresh off DCLT training, hike leaders are ready to inform and engage hikers in the discovery of the unique history, terrain, and species of Land Trust preserves. Themed hikes range from a survey of a preserve’s flora and fauna to how to use popular mobile apps like SEEK—for identifying plants and animals—or the Merlin Bird ID app. If you want to meet up with fellow nature enthusiasts, the Land Trust offerings include citizen science projects and celebratory get-togethers.
