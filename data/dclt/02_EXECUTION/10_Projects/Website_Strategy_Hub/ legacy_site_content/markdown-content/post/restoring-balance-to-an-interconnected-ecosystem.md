399 acres at the Sturgeon Bay Ship Canal Nature Preserve and 50 acres at Heins Creek Nature Preserve are being restored, thanks to funding from the North American Wetland Conservation Act Grant. The project, begun in 2014, has already made great strides to eradicate invasive plants such as buckthorn, honeysuckle, autumn olive, reed canary grass and Phragmites, with the help of professional conservation contractors. Restoration work at these sites will continue through fall of 2018 thanks to additional funding through a Fish and Wildlife Service Partners Program Grant.

<em>Our thanks to the Door County conservation partners who collaborated on the grant proposal and to The Nature Conservancy for securing and coordinating the grant.</em>
