<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Classic and not-so-classic bluegrass music, Door County style. Their toe-tapping, danceable, catchy music is a joy to listen to! Each year, Last Man Standing has provided live music to benefit the Land Trust, whether at our volunteer appreciation parties or as a benefit concert. This year, Last Man Standing will donate all proceeds from this concert to benefit Door County Land Trust’s land protection and stewardship efforts!</span>
