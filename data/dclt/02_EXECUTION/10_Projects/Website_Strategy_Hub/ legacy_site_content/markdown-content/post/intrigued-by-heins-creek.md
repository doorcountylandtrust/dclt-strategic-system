I've always been intrigued by Heins Creek. From the babbling waters to the rippled sandy bottom and crystal clear waters, it is just beautiful. And it's teeming with life! Birds flit in and out of the waters on the edge of the stream. If you stand still enough, you'll see fish of all sizes moving deftly through the currents. I stopped on April 1 to see if suckers had begun to migrate in to spawn. I didn't see them yet, but I did catch a school of young smolts surfing the current and adult steelhead in their spawning ritual. - <strong>Cinnamon Rossman</strong>
