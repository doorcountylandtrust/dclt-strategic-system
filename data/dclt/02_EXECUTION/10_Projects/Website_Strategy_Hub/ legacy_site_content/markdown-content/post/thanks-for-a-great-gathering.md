<span style="font-family: 'quattrocento sans'; font-size: 14pt;">This past weekend marked the 17th winter gathering for Land Trust members and friends. While the name of the event and the location has changed, the strong sense of community and a love of the land remain strong. Many thanks are due to those who attended and supported this fundraiser, but also to the many volunteers who helped at the event. Special thanks is due to the Midwinter Gathering Team: Kathy Blankenburg, Gail Mullaney, Penny Beerntsen, Lucy Klug, Judy Lokken, and Windsor McCutcheon.</span>
