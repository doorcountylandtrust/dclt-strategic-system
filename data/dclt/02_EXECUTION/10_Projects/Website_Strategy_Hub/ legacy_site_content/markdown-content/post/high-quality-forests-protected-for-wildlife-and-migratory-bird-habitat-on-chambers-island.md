<span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Sturgeon Bay, WI</strong> – Door County Land Trust is pleased to announce the permanent protection of significant high-quality forests on Chambers Island. Two parcels totaling 60 acres are now protected, and a third parcel of about 20 acres will be protected before the year’s end. The forest lands consist of a mix of sugar maple, red oak, hemlock, American beech, red maple, white pine, and basswood. The three forested lands add to and connect lands already protected within the Chambers Island Nature Preserve, which now totals nearly 800 acres.</span>

The island offers a much needed rest stop that is free of common hazards to birds, but also offers a diversity of forest and wetland habitats necessary for birds to forage and nest.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">The three forest parcels have been enrolled and maintained in Wisconsin’s Managed Forest program. Sustainable forestry practices on these lands, combined with an absence of deer on the island, results in a forest with a lush understory which further enhances the resilience of the forest. Sustainable forestry practices will continue under Door County Land Trust ownership, with a selective harvest planned approximately every 15 years.</span>

A group of islanders rallied fellow landowners around the vision to create the nature preserve and raised the private funds necessary for both the initial protection and long-term care of the property. In September 2019, these four islanders, Suzanne Fletcher, Mary Brevard, Barbara Frank and Mary Jane Rintelman, were recognized as ‘Conservationists of the Year’ by the Madison based organization Gathering Waters: Wisconsin’s Land Trust Alliance.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Land protection projects like this require strong, local land conservation organizations like Door County Land Trust. In partnership with the community, Door County Land Trust is able to assist in protecting the most ecologically and culturally significant landscapes on the Door Peninsula and islands.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Door County Land Trust seeks support from the community to enable future land protection projects that benefit both the people and wildlife of the peninsula. Whether you hunt, fish, hike or enjoy a walk with your family, Door County Land Trust is here to Protect What You Love.</span>
