<span style="font-size: 14px;">Door County Land Trust is excited to announce its upcoming online event, “Thanks-Giving: Celebrating a Record-Breaking Year of Land Protection” on Wednesday, November 20 at 5:30-7:00 pm on Zoom. This event will reflect on a year of remarkable achievements and the significant contributions of Door County Land Trust’s supporters and volunteers. By year end, the Land Trust will have protected more than 15 properties and cared for nearly 10,000 acres under its protection—thanks to the support of volunteers and members. </span>

<span style="font-size: 14px;">Attendees will hear inspiring success stories that illustrate how the community’s support has made a difference in protecting Door County’s exceptional lands and waters forever. Engaging presentations will highlight the lands and waters permanently protected and stewarded this past year, as well as the breadth of the Land Trust’s citizen science and volunteer initiatives. </span>

<span style="font-size: 14px;">“This event is not just a celebration of the organization’s accomplishments; it’s an opportunity for our supporters and volunteer community to connect and share a vision for how their contributions are shaping the future,” said Community Conservation Coordinator, Paige Witek.  </span>

<span style="font-size: 21px;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Guests will also have the chance to learn about upcoming projects and initiatives that aim to build on this year’s successes. Everyone in the community is invited to this free online celebration of community and collective Thanks-giving!  </span></span>
