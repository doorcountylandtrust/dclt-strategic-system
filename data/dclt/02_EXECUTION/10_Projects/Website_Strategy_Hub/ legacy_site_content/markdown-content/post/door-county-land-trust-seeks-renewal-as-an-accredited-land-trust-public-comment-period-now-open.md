Five years ago, Door County Land Trust was awarded the seal of accreditation by the national Land Trust Alliance Accreditation Commission. The land trust accreditation program recognizes land conservation organizations that meet national quality standards for protecting important natural places and working lands forever.

Door County Land Trust is pleased to announce that it will seek renewal of its status as an accredited land trust. As a part of the renewal process, the Land Trust Alliance Accreditation Commission invites public input and will accept written comments on the Door County Land Trust’s renewal application. A public comment period is now open.

Comments must relate to how Door County Land Trust complies with national quality standards. These standards address the ethical and technical operation of a land trust. For the full list of standards see <a href="http://www.landtrustaccreditation.org/help-and-resources/indicator-practices" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.landtrustaccreditation.org/help-and-resources/indicator-practices</a>.

To learn more about the accreditation program and to submit a comment, visit <a href="https://www.landtrustaccreditation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.landtrustaccreditation.org</a>, or email your comment to info@landtrustaccreditation.org. Comments may also be faxed or mailed to the Land Trust Accreditation Commission, Attn: Public Comments: (fax) 518-587-3183; (mail) 36 Phila Street, Suite 2, Saratoga Springs, NY 12866.

Comments on Door County Land Trust’s application will be most useful by May 21.
