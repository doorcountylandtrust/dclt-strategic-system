<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Anonymous Donor Inspires Giving for Land Protection at Gibraltar-Ephraim Swamp</strong></h2>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Ephraim, WI</strong> – An anonymous couple is inspiring others to give to the Door County Land Trust’s ongoing land protection efforts at Gibraltar-Ephraim Swamp Natural Area. The couple have a love of the Gibraltar-Ephraim Swamp and have been long-time supporters of the efforts to protect the swamp. They have pledged to match donations from first-time contributors to the Gibraltar-Ephraim Swamp land protection project up to $2500. Donations to the project may be made online at <a href="http://www.DoorCountyLandTrust.org">www.DoorCountyLandTrust.org</a>, by calling (920)746-1359 or by mailing a donation to PO Box 65, Sturgeon Bay, WI 54235.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">“We hope this gift inspires folks who may not normally give to the Land Trust to donate for the first time,” said the anonymous couple. “We consider ourselves the god-parents of the swamp. We won’t be here forever though, and we want to make sure it can be protected. Everyone around the swamp and Door County, for that matter, benefits from protecting Gibraltar-Ephraim swamp.”</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Door County Land Trust currently protects more than 275 acres in Gibraltar-Ephraim Swamp and will complete protection of 3 additional properties within the next 2-6 weeks. The Land Trust seeks to raise funds for the conservation costs of these upcoming projects, as well as the long-term care of those lands. Donations given to the Gibraltar-Ephraim Swamp land protection project will help to meet these needs and will help to fund future land protection opportunities in the area.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">“Door County just wouldn’t be the same without our beautiful natural areas,” says Cinnamon Rossman, Door County Land Trust director of charitable giving. “We’re so lucky to live in a place where people are so supportive of conservation. We don’t take for granted that wild lands could become developed without the community effort to protect these places now.”</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">The Gibraltar-Ephraim Swamp Natural Area is one of three areas Door County Land Trust prioritized in their 2020 land protection efforts. The swamp is made up of a vast wetland basin bound on the north, east and south sides by the Niagara Escarpment and upland areas. The swamp plays a crucial role in preserving the quality of waters that flow into Ephraim’s Eagle Harbor. Gibraltar-Ephraim Swamp’s undisturbed wetlands make it attractive to migratory birds and other wildlife. Even Door County’s federally endangered Hine’s emerald dragonfly can be found foraging for insects here.</span>
