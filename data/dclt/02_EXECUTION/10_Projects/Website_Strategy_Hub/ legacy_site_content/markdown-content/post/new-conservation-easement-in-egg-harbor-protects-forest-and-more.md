The Door County Land Trust (DCLT) is excited to announce a newly protected property south of Egg Harbor. Landowners Michael and Ann Morgan donated a conservation easement agreement on their property, protecting it from future development and contributing to nearby protected lands within a unique area between the Niagara Escarpment and the Green Bay shoreline. “We are excited to make this donation of a conservation easement to the Door County Land Trust,” said Ann and Michael. “We wanted to preserve the land for future generations, as well as contribute to the health of the Door County natural environment.”

The land consists of mature northern hardwoods such as sugar maple, American beech, ironwood and basswood and is considered a wet-mesic cedar forest. “Wet-mesic” is a term used to describe the soil moisture levels in natural communities that means that this forest is very moist but not saturated with water. Tree species in this habitat consist of white cedar, white pine, and balsam fir. These habitats provide important resources for migratory birds as well as a wide variety of other wildlife.

Also present on the site is the federally threatened dwarf lake iris. The dwarf lake iris is a species of the upper Great Lakes region, where it grows primarily along the edges of shoreline northern forests. This species has seen significant declines because of habitat reduction by human development. “The property contains one of the highest concentrations of dwarf lake iris in the county,” said Conservation Easement Program Manager Drew Reinke. “I’ve never seen anything like it.” The Morgans are protecting the land’s high ecological value for future generations by prohibiting future development through the conservation easement.

This 13-acre parcel of land adds to a cluster of protected parcels between the Niagara Escarpment and the Green Bay shoreline south of Egg Harbor where Door County Land Trust aims to protect more property in the future.

“In an area facing unprecedented development pressure, preserving these 13 acres of habitat ensures a sanctuary for natives as Door County continues to rapidly grow,” said Executive Director Emily Wood. “We’re proud to partner with landowners like Mike and Ann Morgan to give permanence to their vision to protect this special place, and to inspire other landowners to safeguard these unique landscapes before it is too late.”

This conservation is one of eight conservation easement agreements and ten other land protection projects Door County Land Trust will complete in 2024, highlighting the record-breaking pace of conservation work the non-profit organization has undertaken this year.

The Door County Land Trust encourages landowners countywide to consider using conservation easements as a tool to protect their natural areas and open space from development while maintaining private ownership. Conservation easement donations may provide tax incentives while protecting the natural and scenic character of Door County.
