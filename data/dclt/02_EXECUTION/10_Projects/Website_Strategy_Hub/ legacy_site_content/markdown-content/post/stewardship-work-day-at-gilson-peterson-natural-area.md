Our next volunteer opportunity will be Tuesday, June 6<sup>th</sup>, at Door County Land Trust’s Gilson-Peterson Natural Area. Gilson-Peterson is a 40-acre sanctuary located near Ellison Bay. The forest is dominated by a mixed-aged stand of hemlock, white pine, sugar maple, and beech. We will be hand-pulling forget-me-nots that are invading the forest and crowding out native herbs, such as spring ephemeral wildflowers.

We will be meeting at the work site at 9:00am and will be working until 12:00 pm. Door County Land Trust will bring along any necessary equipment, but if you have your favorite work gloves feel free to bring them. Water and snacks will be available.

Please contact the Door County Land Trust office at (920) 746-1359 to register for the workday and get directions to the preserve.

Door County Land Trust hosts a work party every other Tuesday as part of the Door Stewardship Alliance, in partnership with The Nature Conservancy. To learn about these upcoming work days and be included on email announcements for each work day, <a href="https://www.doorcountylandtrust.org/about-us/contact-us/">sign up to volunteer</a>.
