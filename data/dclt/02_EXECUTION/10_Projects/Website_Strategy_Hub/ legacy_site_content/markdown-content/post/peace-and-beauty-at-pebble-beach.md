<span style="font-size: 14pt;">For years, when our children were little, Pebble Beach was a port of call when we sailed our little family sailboat around Little Sister Bay. We would look forward to having a picnic on the beach. I remember wearing old tennis shoes to walk over the rocks from the sailboat. There was always peace and beauty for us at that beach.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Our daughter Sharon was then about 9 or 10 years old.We are so pleased with the Land Trust’s work to make this incredible site one that will be protected for the enjoyment future generations.</span>
