As we look ahead to the exciting projects on DCLT’s calendar, we want to take a moment to reflect on the incredible successes of 2024. Thanks to the unwavering support of our generous community, we were able to protect a record 17 properties in Door County—ensuring their preservation <em>forever</em>. It’s hard to fully capture the significance of these sites, but key reasons include protecting native species, safeguarding healthy waters, providing public access to conserved land, and honoring family legacies. Below is a month-by-month recap of the successful projects completed throughout 2024...

<strong>January</strong> – The year kicked off with the protection of 10 acres at the headwaters of Three Springs Creek, which flows through Three Springs Nature Preserve into North Bay. This project safeguards an essential part of the local watershed.

<strong>March</strong> – A generous donation of a small parcel of land helped to connect protected properties and provide public access to the Stillpoint Natural Area on Washington Island, expanding the reach of our conservation efforts.

<strong>April</strong> – We protected 20 acres of rare wetlands at Big and Little Marsh, ensuring a lasting habitat for wild, threatened, and endangered species, including the Hine’s emerald dragonfly. This project underscores the importance of safeguarding our region’s wetland ecosystems.

<strong>June</strong> – As Spring drew to a close, two significant projects were completed. First, a 40-acre conservation easement was established in collaboration with conservation-minded landowners. This easement preserves land along Logan Creek, maintaining a vital wildlife corridor for safe animal movement. Additionally, we protected 12 acres of wetland around the Kellner Fen Natural Area, marking the first of three planned projects in this unique ecosystem.

<strong>July</strong> – Summer began with the preservation of two properties beneath Grand View Hill in Ellison Bay, an area crucial for migratory birds to nest and breed. These forested lands were secured at a bargain sale price, ensuring both habitat protection and stunning views. Later in the month, we protected 78 acres along Hibbard Creek, preserving healthy fish habitats and surrounding forest that supports diverse wildlife.

<strong>August</strong> – Another 18 acres adjoining the protected lands at Hibbard Creek were preserved this month, creating over a mile of continuous wildlife corridor—critical for sustaining local ecosystems and wildlife movement.

<strong>September</strong> – We celebrated the historic protection of Camp Cuesta, the beloved Girl Scout Camp, as part of the Kangaroo Lake Nature Preserve. This not only safeguards the land but also preserves the rich traditions of Camp Cuesta for future generations.

<strong>October</strong> – October was a busy and productive month, beginning with the protection of eight acres west of Kellner Fen. This land, featuring a forested ridge and unique wetland areas, is home to rare species, including native carnivorous plants. We also added another 10 acres of land west of Kellner Fen, near the Sturgeon Bay Ship Canal, through a generous donation. This expansion ensures continued protection of this special region. On Washington Island, we secured 12 acres of forest with a conservation easement, providing shelter for nesting and migratory birds. The month closed with the protection of 38 acres in Sister Bay, where water, forest, and bird habitats are now safeguarded through a permanent conservation easement.

<strong>November</strong> – In November, we protected a 13-acre parcel in Egg Harbor through a conservation easement with private landowners. This land is home to the endangered dwarf lake iris, which thrives here more abundantly than anywhere else in Door County.

<strong>December</strong> – The year concluded with two large projects. First, the protection of an 80-acre family orchard in Southern Door. This conservation easement was a heartfelt tribute to the Barnard family, who have tended this land for five generations. The final accomplishment of 2024 was the preservation of a 40-acre working forest, ensuring the property remains undeveloped while allowing the Barnard family to continue their traditional land use.

All of these accomplishments would be impossible without your support. Wholeheartedly, <em>thank you</em>.
Stay tuned for exciting projects ahead - including reaching a milestone 10,000 acres of protected land in Door County - in 2025!
