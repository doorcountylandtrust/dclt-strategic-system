It’s celebrating Earth Week with FREE activities that are open to the public.   </span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="color: #008000;"><a style="color: #008000;" href="https://secure.doorcountylandtrust.org/events-registration-merchandise/event/door-county-geological-journey/"><b>The week is kicked off on Saturday, April 20 with a geology journey walk</b></a></span> with Land Protection Manager Brian Forest. Brian leads you through the forests of the Door County Land Trust’s Lautenbach Woods Nature Preserve located on the Niagara Escarpment. Enjoy Door County’s seasonal wildflowers as well as intriguing discussion on glacial geology, karst features, and challenges of protecting water quality in sensitive areas. </span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Also <span style="color: #000080;"><a style="color: #000080;" href="http://www.kresspavilion.org/calendar"><b><span style="color: #008000;">on April 20, find the Land Trust at the Everyday is Earth Day Celebration</span></b></a> </span>at the Kress Pavilion in Egg Harbor. Stop by the DCLT booth anytime between 10am-4pm.  </span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Then <a href="https://secure.doorcountylandtrust.org/events-registration-merchandise/event/branch-out-for-the-big-plant/"><b>on Tuesday, April 23,</b> <b>join the Land Trust to plant tree seedlings for The Big Plant</b>.</a> Trees filter groundwater, provide habitat for birds and wildlife, improve air quality, and pull carbon from the atmosphere back into the earth. The Land Trust’s event is done in partnership with Climate Change Coalition of Door County’s (CCCDC) The Big Plant. CCCDC coordinates more than 80 community partner organizations each year to plant trees to help combat climate change. </span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b><a href="https://secure.doorcountylandtrust.org/events-registration-merchandise/event/discover-door-countys-frogs/">Take an evening hike on Friday, April 26 to discover Door County’s frogs</a>. </b>Learn the different calls unique to each frog species that lives in Door County’s vernal ponds and wetlands. These calls start the mating ritual as they awaken from their winter state known as brumation. You’ll also discuss all things frogs, including life cycles, the importance of frogs in the ecosystem, and how you can help as a citizen scientist. </span>
