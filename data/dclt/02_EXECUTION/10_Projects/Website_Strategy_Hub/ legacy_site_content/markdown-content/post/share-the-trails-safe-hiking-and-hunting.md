<h2>Be safe this hunting season!</h2>
Did you know that deer gun hunting season begins this Saturday, November 18th and runs through Sunday, November 26th?

Here are some best practices if you are outdoors:
- Wear bright colored clothing
- Dress dogs in bright colored clothing too!
- Stay on marked trails at all times
- Hike during mid-day, not at dawn or dusk
- Use common sense

Many Door County Land Trust nature preserves are open to hunting, but hunters usually avoid trail areas. For the safest hiking, try the Ephraim Preserve at Anderson Pond or White Cliff Nature Preserve in Egg Harbor.
