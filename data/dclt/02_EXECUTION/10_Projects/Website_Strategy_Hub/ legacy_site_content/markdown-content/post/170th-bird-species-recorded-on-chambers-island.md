<div>For a small, four-square-mile island, Chambers Island's list of nesting and migratory birds includes a remarkable number of species deemed as rare, endangered, special concern or of greatest conservation need. For the birds, Chambers Island provides a safe resting stop on their migration or a summer nesting site to raise their young.</div>
<div>Earlier this spring, forester and Chambers Island summer resident, Tim Fitzgerald, spent the morning in the woods with a feathered friend who followed him contently. Tim's photo officially marks the 170th bird species recorded on Chambers Island. While the Yellow-headed blackbird is fairly common on the island, sightings like these are daily reminders of the incredible creatures and plants sustained by our land protection work--and of the reasons we must continue protecting Door County's open spaces and wild places.</div>
