<h2><strong>Wild Words: Storytellers Share </strong><strong>Their Take on Door County’s Natural Treasures</strong></h2>
<strong>Sturgeon Bay, WI –  </strong>On Thursday, October 19, 7pm at Crossroads at Big Creek, Sturgeon Bay, eight storytellers will take the stage to share their interpretation of the theme ‘Discovering Door County’s Treasures.’ Wild Words is a collaborative project between the Door County Land Trust and Write On, Door County. The program is free and open to the public. Join us for light refreshments and the chance to talk with our storytellers after the program.

In a story format called pecha kucha, Japanese for chit-chat, stories are presented using 20 pictures, and 20 seconds per picture, for a six-minute, forty-second story. Amongst the eight storytellers featured on Thursday night are two of the Land Trust’s own volunteer hike leaders, Roxanne Hanney and Marilyn Hein, conservation colleague from The Nature Conservancy Mike Grimm, photo-journalist and author Thomas Jordan, Land Trust board member Gretchen Schmelzer, actor and poet Ed DiMaio, local conservationist Bob Bultman, and recently returned Door County native Laura Beck Nielsen.

“When I moved here, no one was going outside.  The polar vortex had everyone cooped up,” said first-time Wild Words storyteller Thomas Jordan. “But, I was out there with my camera. I want to show people why they need to be here, all year.” Jordan’s story features 20 photographs, including some from his recently published book, “Secret Treasures of Door County.”

Door County Land Trust executive director Tom Clay stands behind the storytelling night, saying “This is a way to bring people together to share and listen to each other…To hear what is most important about this amazing and special place we call home. Stories amplify understanding and personal connection—and for the Land Trust, it’s all about a connection to the land and water.”

“We believe everyone has a story to tell,” said executive director of Write On, Door County Jerod Santek.  “Wild Words is the perfect opportunity for writers to give their stories life through pictures and spoken word.”

Interested storytellers may still register to participate with the Door County Land Trust before Tuesday, October 17. Visit the website at <a href="http://www.DoorCountyLandTrust.org/WildWords">www.DoorCountyLandTrust.org/WildWords</a> for more information or call the office at (920)746-1359.
