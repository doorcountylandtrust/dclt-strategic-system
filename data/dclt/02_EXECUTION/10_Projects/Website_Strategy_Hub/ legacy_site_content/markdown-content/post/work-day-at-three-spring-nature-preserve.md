<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Dust off you hiking boots; we’re having a work party! Come join us outside for a morning of restoration work to remove invasive species at Three Springs Nature Preserve. Our focus for the day will be on reducing and removing non-native and highly invasive scots pine trees. We will bring all the necessary gear and information, all you need to bring is a smile and helping hand! If you’re interested in learning more about how to identify and control scot pine, or just need an excuse to get outdoors then this is for you!</span>
