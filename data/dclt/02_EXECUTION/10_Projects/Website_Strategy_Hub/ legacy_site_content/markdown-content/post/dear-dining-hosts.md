<span style="font-family: 'quattrocento sans'; font-size: 14pt;">In 2004, several visionary volunteers conceived an idea to help support the Door County Land Trust. The concept was creative and ambitious. The Dining for Open Spaces event series was born. Proceeds from a series of small events held in host's homes and at the Land Trust nature preserves would support land protection projects around Door County. You rallied together, helping the Dining series to raise nearly $300,000 to date. Now, as the Land Trust begins its 30th Anniversary, we look forward to new events that continue to bring us together in unexpected and fruitful ways.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'quattrocento sans'; font-size: 14pt;">What makes Dining for Open Spaces such a remarkable concept? It's the people. Members like you are at the heart of the Dining series. Thank you for sharing your passion for land protection and for contributing to the Land Trust's success by hosting a Dining event.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'quattrocento sans'; font-size: 14pt;">The 2016 Dining for Open Spaces series is taking shape now and we invite you to help carry on the Dining tradition. As the size of events has grown, so has the need for enthusiastic hosts! We are inviting you to help by hosting or co-hosting one of the following events:</span>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family: 'quattrocento sans'; font-size: 14pt;">Sunset Cruise on the Washington Island Ferry</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: 'quattrocento sans'; font-size: 14pt;"> Trolley Tour of Conservation Easements</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: 'quattrocento sans'; font-size: 14pt;">Ship Canal History Adventure and Fireboat Cruise</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: 'quattrocento sans'; font-size: 14pt;">Road Rally and Scavenger Hunt</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: 'quattrocento sans'; font-size: 14pt;">Brunch or Lunch on the Farm: Waseda Farms</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: 'quattrocento sans'; font-size: 14pt;">Or, something entirely new!</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-family: 'quattrocento sans'; font-size: 14pt;">What does hosting or co-hosting an event entail? Hosts and co-hosts work together to plan greeting, food and beverage, activities, and a great experience for guests. Most events are planned within a few phone or email conversations to divide and conquer the necessary tasks. Hosts and co-hosts divide costs, usually with a maximum of $250 per couple, so that all ticket proceeds from guests support land preservation.</span>
