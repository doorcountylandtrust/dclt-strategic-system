Large-scale land preservation is made possible by broad community support from donors at every level.

Dear Door County Land Trust Community,

In response to Governor Evers’ Order for Statewide School Closure, beginning March 18, 2020, Door County Land Trust’s office is closed with an anticipated reopening on May 26, 2020. During this period our staff is performing field work and teleworking via email. <a href="http://www.doorcountylandtrust.org/about-us/staff-information/">If you need to reach myself or a member of our staff, email addresses can be found on our staff page.</a>

Also, through May 26, 2020, we are canceling all scheduled events and non-essential work travel including off-site meetings, seminars, speaking engagements, and conferences. Please note that the May 26, 2020 date to recommence normal operations is subject to change pending further information.

Our nature preserves, however, remain open and we encourage you to experience all that nature has to offer, especially during this very difficult time. From arriving neotropical songbirds to blooming spring wildflowers, we can find comfort in the fact that nature will not be deterred – nor should we.

Thank you for your understanding and thank you for your continued support of Door County Land Trust.

Sincerely,
Tom Clay
Executive Director
