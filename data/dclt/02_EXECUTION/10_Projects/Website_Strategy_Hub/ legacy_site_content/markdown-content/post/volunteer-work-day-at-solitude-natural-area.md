We are continuing our efforts to control pesky Scots Pine (<em>Pinus sylvestris</em>) at Solitude Natural Area. Scots Pine is a non-native pine tree that grows more aggressively than other species, crowding out other trees and preventing desirable native species from growing. More information can be found here <a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001YArL2mpIQGxB5V5IW26ILn-mj0uk6Ia5SGGIBXFsyQEg_Y5WhJXDWxccJqYx62fm2tw0_iKp6oEdgt9vVLgVMNJkqodbA2KlOnFp7X9dQv-8GHXM3fDUZlBvo0bz3ab_XUljmn2qusCmXFUd5uE5ildwEXaWdfvtojpXQtu6ZvYk5o4SSpyOc8UXQA_HccKDY8W_AaepnLEXinx2x66vKQ==&amp;c=jdCOiUAaNuXAURhoXt4eV--gleTFsuhuYMaUolMLzuGgrCAo3YItaQ==&amp;ch=Y66YI91en2EURCkDT2X5Tk5vlPJ1zgPtHB27n75dxGTY8-y-4CpsgA==">https://www.na.fs.fed.us/fhp/invasive_plants/weeds/scots-pine.pdf</a>.

Please meet in the Solitude Natural Area trailhead located at 6759 Logerquist Road at 10:00 am. We are in need of help cutting small Scots Pine using loppers. The Land Trust will bring all necessary equipment, but if you have a favorite pair of work gloves or loppers, feel free to bring them!
