The Door County Land Trust and Write On, Door County invite you to tell a story about ‘Discovering Door County’s Treasures’ at an event to take place on Thursday, October 19, from 7:00-9:00 pm at Crossroads at Big Creek, Sturgeon Bay.

Storytellers are invited to interpret the theme, ‘Discovering Door County’s Treasures,’ in a story accompanied by pictures, a format called “pecha kucha” which is Japanese for chit-chat. Using twenty pictures and twenty seconds per picture, each story will be 6 minutes and 40 seconds long.

‘Discovering Door County’s Treasures’ is also the theme of the upcoming Door County Treasure Hunt, an event that will send teams out to search the Peninsula, looking for clues and accumulating points for prizes. Storytellers looking for inspiration may find it through the Treasure Hunt clue book published by Write On, Door County. Clue books are available through the Door County Land Trust office in Sturgeon Bay or through Edgewood Orchard Gallery in Fish Creek.

Anyone in the community is invited to be a storyteller. Door County Land Trust staff will guide interested storytellers in the process of creating their story. Guidelines, tips for telling stories and registration for storytellers may be found online at www.DoorCountyLandTrust.org/WildWords.

The event, “Wild Words: Discovering Door County’s Treasures,” October 19, 7:00-9:00 pm at Crossroads at Big Creek, will be free and open to the public.
