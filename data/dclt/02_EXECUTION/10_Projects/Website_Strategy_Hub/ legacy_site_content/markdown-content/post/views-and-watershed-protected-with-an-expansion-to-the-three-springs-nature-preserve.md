Most importantly, it helps protect the groundwater that flows into nearby Three Springs Creek and, eventually, North Bay. Protecting water quality in this area known as a hot-spot of biological diversity is good for the environment and good for the folks that live nearby.  A big thanks goes out to the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Fund, the National Coastal Wetland Grant Program and Door County Land Trust supporters for helping preserve this special place.  <a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001_scw6aWtOQjqVOvFTQ_sW5lHsMrflHyJYJOxjtuDSdLM30xuWXkfMdHQl7Er_Ce1oNxYMr0aNfuuzwV9-_evBkjKMbHsXNaibcDjztMPxmSuT6SNzQwifXoZneEAipOPBedRTwsu4Kr_7bJGDZOo_IvV8ug4YCIureKhmbjS3WYddslufFDr_S-PQFsh6f_O"><strong>Click here for directions to Three Springs Nature Preserve and a trail map.</strong></a>
