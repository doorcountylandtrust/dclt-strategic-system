<span data-contrast="auto">Joint Press Release: Girl Scouts of the Northwestern Great Lakes (GSNWGL) proudly announce they have reached an agreement to sell Camp Cuesta in Baileys Harbor to the Door County Land Trust. This strategic partnership would ensure the continued availability of Camp Cuesta for local Girl Scouts and the preservation of this cherished property.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Located adjacent to the Door County Land Trust’s 281-acre Kangaroo Lake Nature Preserve, this 24-acre camp has been a destination for local Girl Scouts to build on their environmental stewardship and outdoor skills for nearly 50 years. The decision to transfer ownership to the Door County Land Trust was made with the utmost consideration for the well-being and future of local Girl Scouts. This collaboration will ensure that the camp remains a valuable resource that will be protected for generations.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">“We have mixed emotions about selling Camp Cuesta, but we are excited about the future with the Door County Land Trust,” said Patti Shafto-Carlson, CEO of GSNWGL. “Their commitment to preserving and maintaining the property aligns perfectly with our vision and values. This partnership ensures that Camp Cuesta will be a place where Girl Scouts and others can connect with nature, have meaningful outdoor experiences, and create lasting memories.” </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span>
