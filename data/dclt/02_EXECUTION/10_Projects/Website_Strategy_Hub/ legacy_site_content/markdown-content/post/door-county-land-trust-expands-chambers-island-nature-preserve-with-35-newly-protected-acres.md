<span style="font-family: 'quattrocento sans'; font-size: 14pt;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-5060 size-full" src="https://www.doorcountylandtrust.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/chambers-island-web.jpg" alt="chambers island" width="780" height="444" /></span>

<span style="font-family: 'quattrocento sans'; font-size: 14pt;">The Door County Land Trust is pleased to announce that 35 acres of forested uplands have been acquired as an addition to the Door County Land Trust’s 600-acre Chambers Island Nature Preserve. With the October protection of two islands within Lake Mackaysee, this acquisition is the second of five new land deals to be completed on Chambers Island this year. Chambers Island is recognized by Door County conservation partners as a high priority wildlife habitat primarily because of the number of species of birds which migrate and nest on the island, as well as its unique forests and wetlands.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'quattrocento sans'; font-size: 14pt;">“The protection of the interior of Chambers Island is a long-term vision that Island landowners and the Door County Land Trust have partnered to implement over the past five years. With the addition of this parcel, and several more planned before the end of 2018, high-quality forests within the island will be permanently protected,” shares Door County Land Trust Land Program Director Julie Schartner.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'quattrocento sans'; font-size: 14pt;">The protected parcel was purchased by the Land Trust with funding from the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, a grant from the Bock Foundation, contributions from Chambers Island landowners, individual donors and Land Trust members. Door County Land Trust continues fundraising efforts to meet a  $350,000 goal for the completion of the Chambers Island Nature Preserve including additional land protection, long-term care of the property, interpretive signs and the removal of invasive species.</span>
