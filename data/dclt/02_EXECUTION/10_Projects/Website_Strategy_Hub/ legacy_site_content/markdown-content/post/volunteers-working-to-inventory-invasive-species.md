Mapping and inventorying invasive species not only tells us what is present, but allows us to be strategic and prioritize our efforts going forward. Volunteers worked to inventory and map invasive species at Oak Road Nature Preserve in 2016 so treatments could begin this spring, in June of 2017. Now, volunteers are following these maps for targeted invasive species removal and continuing the mapping process at other nature preserves.  Volunteer Preserve Stewards and crews are working to inventory all invasive plants at all of the Door County Land Trust nature preserves and natural areas. <a href="https://www.doorcountylandtrust.org/about-us/contact-us/"><strong><u>Join our efforts today! </u></strong></a>
