Join us to help "spruce" up the native woodland landscape at the Door County Land Trust's Sturgeon Bay office. There are many tasks to choose from: pruning, edging, raking and more! Garden tools will be provided, but bring your own if you like. We'll be tutored by the experts from Door Landscape, so it's also a great opportunity to learn to ID our Door County native plants and see how they can be used in an urban setting. </span>

<span style="font-family: 'quattrocento sans'; font-size: 14pt;">We'll start at 8:30 am, but feel free to arrive on your own schedule. Come for a couple of hours or stay the day! Morning goodies, beverages and a pizza lunch will be provided. Each participant will<em> receive a coupon for 10% off the purchase of any one nursery item</em> during the month of May at Door Landscape!</span>
