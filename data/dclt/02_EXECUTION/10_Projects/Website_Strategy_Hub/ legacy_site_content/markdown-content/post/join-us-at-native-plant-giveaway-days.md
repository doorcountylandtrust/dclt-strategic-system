In cooperation with The Big Plant, the Door County Land Trust will be giving away native evergreen and perennial seedlings on the Saturdays of May 13 and 20. On both days, the events begin at 9am and will continue until all plants are gone. The May 13 giveaway will be located at<strong> </strong>the Southern Door School parking lot at 2073 County Rd DK in Brussels. On May 20, plants may be picked up at the Stabbur Beer Garden at Al Johnson’s, 10698 N. Bay Shore Drive in Sister Bay.

The evergreens include white pine, white spruce, and balsam fir. The perennials selected are New England aster, golden Alexander, and marsh blazing star. These native plants will easily thrive in sun to part-sun in most Door County soils and will attract bees, butterflies, and other native pollinators.

Event attendees may choose up to three plants in any combination of species to take home.
