The Door County Land Trust recently purchased 63 acres that will extend the protection of water quality and wildlife surrounding the organization’s Kellner Fen Natural Area, located near the Lake Michigan shoreline north of Sturgeon Bay. Kellner Fen is a unique type of wetland that features a large expanse of open water and an extensive, fragile sedge mat that floats on top of the underlying water.

This recent addition to the natural area provides an opportunity to increase the protection of several rare species in an equally rare habitat, including carnivorous plants like pitcher plants. The fen and its surrounding dense forests provide refuge and foraging opportunities for migratory and nesting birds. It’s also the habitat of choice for unusual species of insects like the Hine’s emerald dragonfly.
“This land acquisition supports the Land Trust’s continuing goals to protect the water quality of wetlands, coastal ridge and swale complexes, contiguous forest canopy and biodiversity, and migratory corridors,” said Land Program Director Jesse Koyen.

The success of the purchase is the direct result of the generosity of the Fischer family. Xan and John Fischer of Sturgeon Bay made a significant donation in their family’s name to contribute to any expansion of the Kellner Fen Natural Area and its permanent protection. Then, last fall the couple set the Land Trust’s Fischer Challenge campaign in motion to entice the community to match their gift and contribute funds for other conservation projects around the county. Hundreds of donors matched—and then exceeded—the Fischer family’s original challenge.

The Door County Land Trust would like to thank Xan and John Fischer for their generous donation to protect Kellner Fen and for sparking the Fischer Challenge to protect more of Door County.
