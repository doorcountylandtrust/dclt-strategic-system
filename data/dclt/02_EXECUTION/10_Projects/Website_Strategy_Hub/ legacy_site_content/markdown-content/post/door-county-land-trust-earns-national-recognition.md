<span style="font-family: 'quattrocento sans'; font-size: 14pt;">Sturgeon Bay, WI August 18, 2016 - The Door County Land Trust announced today it has achieved accreditation - a mark of distinction in land conservation. The nationally-recognized Land Trust Accreditation Commission awards accreditation to land trusts that meet standards for excellence, uphold the public trust and ensure that their conservation efforts are permanent.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'quattrocento sans'; font-size: 14pt;">Cathy Fiorato, secretary of the Door County Land Trust board of directors and leader of the accreditation application process says, "Our mission statement is a promise: 'To protect Door County's exceptional lands and waters forever,' and as an accredited land trust we are confident that we can keep that promise to our community, our conservation partners, and our donors." Earning the seal of accreditation is a validation of the strength of the Door County Land Trust's work since 1986 and an assurance that future work will uphold the same high standards. Accreditation advances excellence and fosters continuous improvement as land trusts maintain their accredited status by applying for renewal every five years.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'quattrocento sans'; font-size: 14pt;">The Door County Land Trust has protected more than 7,000 acres from Washington Island to southern Door County, WI. In 2016, the Door County Land Trust will complete more than 9 land acquisition projects, an expansion of about 650 acres. In addition, the organization maintains and stewards these lands with ongoing reforestation and wildlife habitat improvements, such as the recent planting of 1800 trees at three protected properties. The largest landscape-scale restoration project of the Land Trust is currently underway at the Sturgeon Bay Ship Canal Nature Preserve, where more than 300 acres will be restored to ecological health.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'quattrocento sans'; font-size: 14pt;">The Door County Land Trust joins the more than 350 accredited land trusts that demonstrate their commitment to professional excellence through accreditation, helping to maintain the public's trust in their work. Tammara Van Ryn, executive director of the Commission says, "Accredited land trusts stand together, united behind strong ethical standards ensuring the places people love will be conserved forever. This network of land trusts has demonstrated fiscal accountability, strong organizational leadership and lasting stewardship of conservation land."</span>

<span style="font-family: 'quattrocento sans'; font-size: 14pt;">Each accredited land trust meets extensive documentation requirements and undergoes a comprehensive review as part of its accreditation application. The process is rigorous and strengthens land trusts so they can help landowners and communities achieve their goals.</span>
