# Focus Group–Derived Moodboard Evaluation Framework

---

## 1. Values & Keywords

**Source:** Directly distilled from rebrand focus group transcripts (Eco Lifestyle, Legacy Conservationists, Land Trust Discussion Group).

These represent *non-negotiables* and emotional anchors for design evaluation.

| **Category** | **Keywords / Phrases** | **Notes / Implications for Design** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Trust & Credibility** | authentic, professional, grounded, consistent | Avoid gimmicks; ensure long-term recognizability |
| **Connection to Place** | Door County terrain, bluff lines, shoreline, native species | Depict specific local features accurately; reject generic landscapes |
| **Legacy & Stewardship** | enduring, legacy, serious, responsibility | Favor timeless over trendy; convey gravitas |
| **Accessibility & Clarity** | legible, clear, straightforward | Prioritize readability; avoid over-stylization that hinders clarity |
| **Aesthetic Preferences** | realism, natural textures, heritage tones | Textures over flat minimalism; avoid overly abstract or playful styles |
| **Symbolic Integrity** | meaningful symbols, accurate species | Avoid symbolic clichés (e.g., eagles if perceived as generic) |

## 2. Design Evaluation Rubric

**Purpose:** Create a consistent, defensible method to score moodboards or design directions against focus group-derived values.

**Scoring Scale:**

- **5 = Strongly aligned** — fully embodies value, no trade-offs
- **4 = Aligned** — generally meets expectations, minor gaps
- **3 = Neutral/mixed** — partial alignment or trade-offs present
- **2 = Weak** — mostly misses the mark, noticeable conflicts
- **1 = Misaligned** — directly conflicts with expressed values

| **Criteria** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Authenticity & Trustworthiness** | Feels genuine, professional, and credible to both traditional and modern audiences |
| **Connection to Place** | Accurately conveys Door County’s unique geography, ecology, and cultural feel |
| **Legacy & Longevity** | Has timeless appeal; will age well over decades |
| **Clarity & Readability** | Design elements are easy to understand at all sizes and mediums |
| **Texture & Tone** | Uses textures, colors, and styles aligned with heritage, realism, and natural beauty |
| **Symbolic Relevance** | Symbols carry meaning tied to mission and avoid focus group “red flags” |

## 3. Pre-Filled Scoring Table: Current Moodboard Directions

**Directions:** Score each moodboard (A, B, C) across all criteria; add total to compare.

| **Criteria** | **Weight** | **A – Moodboard A** | **B– Moodboard B** | **C – Moodboard C** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Authenticity & Trustworthiness | 1x | 5 | 3 | 4 |
| Connection to Place | 1x | 5 | 2 | 3 |
| Legacy & Longevity | 1x | 4 | 3 | 3 |
| Clarity & Readability | 1x | 4 | 2 | 4 |
| Texture & Tone | 1x | 5 | 2 | 3 |
| Symbolic Relevance | 1x | 4 | 2 | 3 |
| **Total Score** | — | **27** | **14** | **20** |

## 4. Next Steps

1. **Validate Scoring:** Share with team for quick gut-check and adjust as needed.
2. **Iterate on High-Scoring Concept(s):** Focus refinements on A, incorporating any small wins from B (clarity, sans-serif).
3. **Document Rationale:** Keep this page updated so future design decisions can reference the reasoning.
4. **Apply Consistently:** Use rubric for future sub-brand or collateral design decisions.
