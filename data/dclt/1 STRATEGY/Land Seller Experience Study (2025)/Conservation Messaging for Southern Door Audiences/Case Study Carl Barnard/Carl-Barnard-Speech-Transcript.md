# Carl Barnard Speech Transcript

00:03:31:04 - 00:03:58:07

Thank you for all coming. And welcome to our farm. My brother Bill couldn't be here today, but Bill and I decided we wanted to save this land that has our family's blood in the soil. We love the land. We love the trees. We decided to prevent this property from becoming condominiums.

00:03:58:10 - 00:04:22:23

We decided we didn't want no trespassing signs, and we didn't want driveways all over. So what we did was, is we look at the planning that needed to be done and the land trust, is a trust is near and dear to us. And so we donated the building rights to the land trust. There's still a working farm.

00:04:22:23 - 00:04:49:28

We have. We have apples. We used to have 80 acres of cherries. Well, we had another farm. It was about 150 acres of cherries. We've got corn. But what we're doing is we're transforming it back to what I would like to see it be. And we've we've got 17 acres of land that we're putting into Prairie and Monarch habitat.

00:04:50:01 - 00:05:18:21

Really? This land here will all be divided up, for the animals. We've got people nesting on our property. We've got bluebirds. We've got, all those that migrate. We had one year when we had hundreds of thousands of monarchs migrate through and they. I got pictures of them on the apple trees. And when the sun comes up in the morning, there were also two.

00:05:18:21 - 00:05:43:09

There were there were they were at a at their slumber at night. And as soon as the sun was hit, the east side of the tree, they started to come up and, you know, fly. And the ones on the west side were still there. That's the kind of thing that you can't you can't buy, you know. I always say that they don't make any more land, but they make a lot of investments and money and.

00:05:43:11 - 00:06:01:21

And what what's the money going to do it? What's the money going to do for you? This land will be here for our family and for the benefit of the county forever. It's it's not going to be developed now. What we were hoping to do.

00:06:01:24 - 00:06:21:23

What? What we're hoping to do is to have everybody here think of two people that have land that they could do what we did. Every farmer plant seeds, and I would like to see this seed come to fruition.

00:06:21:25 - 00:06:47:05

If they have any questions about the legality, if they have any questions about the financial aspects, about how this works. I can talk to it. This is such a great. There's probably 200 farms from here to to gills row of people my age where the kids live in California and North Carolina. What am I going to do with it?

00:06:47:08 - 00:07:13:07

They can they can do something to preserve Door County for what it was and see that that will be what it is, what it's going to be. But they need to think. They need to understand that it can be done. So if we could be kind of a starting point and people would say, oh, there's 140 acres of trees here, there's some woods or some farmland.

00:07:13:09 - 00:07:37:01

They can still live there. They can still control it, but they just will never build it. Need to have a holding tape. I think it would take several people to talk to and have them contact your county land trust. They can contact me because I can actually tell them the tax benefits. I can tell them what? What can happen.

00:07:37:24 - 00:07:57:04

I don't I don't know how to say it any better than that, because pretty soon, you know, I'll just use this as an example. Down the road, you see a whole bunch of new houses up here, you're going to see a whole bunch of new houses. That guy died. He's got his his land all divided around. That guy died and it's getting divided.

00:07:57:07 - 00:08:26:23

And that's happening all over. Not just here. Let's try to save some of this and have this be, a pivot point for some people thinking. Oh, yeah, I never thought about that. We can keep the farm in the family and we could get a tax benefit, and it can be here, everybody forever. People won't remember who I am, but they'll remember what this land is because it will always be here.

00:08:26:25 - 00:08:40:14

Thank you for coming. And welcome to this.
