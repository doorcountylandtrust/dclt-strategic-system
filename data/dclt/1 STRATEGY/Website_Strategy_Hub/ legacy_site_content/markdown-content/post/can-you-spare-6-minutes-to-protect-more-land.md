<td><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This note is a request for six minutes of your time in the next few days. Your six minutes will help protect more of Door County's exceptional lands and waters. Your six minutes can protect the the things you love about Door County!</span>

Please take six minutes (three minutes per call) to call our two state legislators, Representative Joel Kitchens and Senator Andre Jacques, and ask them to support a 10 year extension of the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Program. You could also send them an email, but an email takes a little more of your time and well, it just doesn’t have the same impact as a call.

Here’s why phone calls right now from all of us are important: The Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Program is a critical source of funding for land preservation in Wisconsin and it is in danger of being cut from the state budget or extended for only a short time.

During past year, the pandemic highlighted the importance of our preserved lands. With few recreational options, people discovered anew the joy of outdoor recreation - the wonder of a simple walk in the woods.

Since its inception in 1989, the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Program has invested almost 31 million dollars in Door County. Those investments help conserve the unique characteristics that make Door County special. Land preservation supports a fragile ecosystem and supports our local economy, too. We love to live here and tourists love to visit because of Door County’s natural beauty. In our neighborhood, a Knowles-Nelson grant was used in the purchase of the Bayshore Blufflands Nature Preserve. Knowles-Nelson funding has also been used recently for preservation projects that include:

·     <strong>Sister Bay Waterfront Park</strong>

·     <strong>Ahnapee State Trail</strong>

·     <strong>Mink River Estuary </strong>

·     <strong>Jacksonport Lakeside Park Expansion</strong>

·     <strong>and nearly every Door County Land Trust nature preserve!</strong>

Our legislators are currently engaged in budgeting and in party caucuses that determine budget priorities. <strong>Please help maintain this essential funding source by making a phone call today and leaving a message for Representative Kitchens and Senator Jacques.</strong>

It’s easy. Here’s how to reach their offices and a suggestion of what to say:

<hr />

<strong>Senator Andre Jacque
</strong>(608) 266-3512

The program helps to preserve recreational areas and the unique natural beauty of Door County. Recreation and natural beauty promote tourism and create a strong local economy for us. Thank you.</em>”

<hr />

<strong>Representative Joel Kitchens
</strong>(608) 266-5350
<a href="mailto:Rep.Kitchens@legis.Wisconsin.gov">Rep.Kitchens@legis.Wisconsin.gov</a>

“<em>I am calling to thank Representative Kitchens for his past support of the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Program. I ask that he continue to strongly support a 10 year extension of the program. The program helps to preserve recreational areas and the unique natural beauty Door County which in turn, promotes tourism and creates a strong local economy. Thank you.</em>”

<strong>Your six minutes spent calling legislators is a great investment in our beautiful county.</strong> Thank you for your help in this important effort!
