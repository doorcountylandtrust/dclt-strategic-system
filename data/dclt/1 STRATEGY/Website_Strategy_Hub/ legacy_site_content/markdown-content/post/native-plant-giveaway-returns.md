&nbsp;

<strong>Door County, WI –</strong>Door County Land Trust (DCLT) is pleased to invite the community to a tree and plant giveaway to be held at the Epicenter Building (217 N 4<sup>th</sup> Ave, Sturgeon Bay) Saturday, May 17. The plant selection includes three trees – balsam fir, white pine, and white spruce – as well as four pollinator-friendly perennials: New England aster, golden Alexander, common ironweed, and marsh blazing star. DCLT sponsors the tree and plant giveaway in collaboration with Climate Change Coalition of Door County and their tree planting effort, the Big Plant, which includes tree planting events throughout the county.

&nbsp;

Plants and trees will be given away beginning at 10am until supplies run out. Plants will not be available before 10am. The giveaway takes place in the parking lot of the Epicenter building, which houses the DCLT office, at 217 N. 4<sup>th</sup> Avenue in Sturgeon Bay.

&nbsp;

DCLT believes Door County must be valued and cared for by the community to withstand future threats to the environment. This belief aligns with the goals of the Big Plant, in which trees are planted to support local ecosystems, sequester carbon, clean the air, filter groundwater, protect streams, provide shade, and beautify the landscape. The mission of the Big Plant is to inspire as many people as possible to plant and grow as many native trees as possible. DCLT offers native perennials as an option for folks who may not have space to grow trees. Even a small containerized garden on your porch can offer sustenance that is valuable to pollinators.

<strong>Why Native Plants Matter</strong>

&nbsp;

Door County is rich in biodiversity and natural beauty, but the native landscape has historically been altered by humans for uses such as orchards, pastureland, and development. The county’s wildlife is evolutionarily dependent on native plants for food and shelter. Planting native trees and perennials ensures Door County remains a place where native birds, pollinators, and other wildlife can thrive.

&nbsp;

When land is developed, it is often replanted with non-native ornamental landscaping plants which are less adapted to the local environment, requiring more fertilizer, water, and maintenance than native plants. Non-native landscapes can sometimes include invasive species that can escape cultivation and compete for the same resources as native plants, without the ecological benefit to local wildlife.

&nbsp;

Native plants are part of the region’s natural identity. By planting native plants, you help restore and preserve the ecological and natural heritage of Door County. Join in the efforts to maintain a healthy environment by taking home free native plants this weekend!
