<strong>Jim Perry</strong> is a noted Door County photographer who captures the essence of the Door County Land Trust. You can follow his breathtaking images of the Door County Land Trust nature preserves in his daily social media posts. Jim captures the beauty and sense of place, literally, taking the viewer to places they may have never been before. He's a real ambassador for the Door County Land Trust, listing the location of his photo posts so others can explore the natural beauty of the Door County landscape.

<strong>Terri Warpinski</strong> is Professor Emerita of Art at the University of Oregon. Her B.A. degree is from the University of Wisconsin in Green Bay, and she holds both an M.A. and M.F.A from the University of Iowa. Her photographically based creative practice, reflecting an expertise that bridges the span from handcrafted historical practices to digital media, explores the relationship between personal, cultural and natural histories.

<strong>The exhibit will run starting February 3 through May 29 and the public is invited to the opening reception with the artists at the Kress Pavilion on February 5 from 4-7 p.m. with the artists speaking 5:30 p.m.</strong>
