Dear Friends,

Can you imagine an issue that 90% of Wisconsin voters agree on? A <a href="https://www.nature.org/en-us/newsroom/overwhelming-bipartisan-support-for-public-funding-for-conservation-in-wisconsin/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">recent survey</a> by The Nature Conservancy shows overwhelming public support for state funding dedicated to conserving our land, water, and wildlife—proving just how deeply Wisconsinites value our natural resources.

For over 30 years, the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Program has been the cornerstone of conservation funding in Wisconsin, protecting groundwater, lakes, streams, forests, and wildlife habitats and enhancing recreational infrastructure across the state. This program has been absolutely vital to the success of the Door County Land Trust as well as our partners at The Ridges and The Nature Conservancy.

Now Knowles Nelson appears to be at serious risk of not being reauthorized in the 2025-27 budget. Several legislative leaders have predicted its demise while the Governor is expected to propose a large funding increase. This program is in danger of becoming a partisan issue, despite its very broad popularity across party lines. We must band together to fight to preserve Knowles Nelson – to demonstrate to our representatives in Madison that this is a critical issue that is important to everyone – to our health and wellbeing and to our economy.

<strong>Why This Matters to Door County Land Trust</strong>

Thanks to the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Program, the Door County Land Trust has been able to:
<ul>
 	<li>Protect <strong>over 4,700 acres</strong> across 105 projects totaling an investment of <strong>$15.2 million</strong>.</li>
 	<li>Preserve <strong>480+ acres</strong> within Bay Shore Blufflands State Natural Area, including Bay Shore Blufflands and Lautenbach Woods Nature Preserves.</li>
 	<li>Safeguard <strong>over 600 acres</strong> of critical migratory bird habitat on Chambers Island.</li>
 	<li>Support the protection of <strong>over 550 acres</strong> within North Bay State Natural Area, including Three Springs Nature Preserve.</li>
 	<li>Protect <strong>400+ acres</strong> of significant wetlands in Gibraltar-Ephraim Swamp, one of Door County’s largest coastal wetlands.</li>
</ul>
This program also supports Wisconsin’s $9.8 billion outdoor recreation economy, which contributes $5 billion in wages annually. Numerous village and town parks, marinas and other outdoor infrastructure in Door County have been funded in part by the program – from Cana Island, to Pebble Beach, the Sister Bay marina, Egg Harbor’s shore land acquisition, the Town of Gibraltar boat ramp, the Ahnapee trail and numerous Sturgeon Bay and state park improvements.  At just $11 per resident, the Stewardship Fund delivers more than <strong>$2.5 billion in clean air, water, outdoor infrastructure and flood protection services</strong> every year.

<strong><em>This is a fantastic program that needs your voice! </em></strong>
