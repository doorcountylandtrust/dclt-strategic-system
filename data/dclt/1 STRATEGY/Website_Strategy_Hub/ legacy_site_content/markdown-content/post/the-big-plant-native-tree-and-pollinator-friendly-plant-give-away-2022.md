<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Each of these plants and trees is hardy in Door County and is beneficial to insects, birds and wildlife. The trees and plants are not potted and need to be planted the day they are picked up.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Plants and trees are free; a donation is optional. </span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Door County Land Trust’s tree and plant give-away event is sponsored by Tom and Bev Lisle, with additional donations from other Land Trust members.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Details about the tree and plant selections will be available at <a href="http://www.DoorCountyLandTrust.org/BigPlant">www.DoorCountyLandTrust.org/BigPlant</a>. We suggest reviewing tree and plant info in advance to help choose the right species for your soil type and level of sunlight. Volunteers will be available to answer questions on the day of the event.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>
Sturgeon Bay, WI</strong> – Door County Land Trust will give away 2,000 native tree and plant seedlings over the next month.  The trees and plants are free and will be available at scheduled locations from Sister Bay to Southern Door over the next four weekends. <strong>Saturday, April 30, 10-12</strong> – Sturgeon Bay, YMCA Healthy Kids Day; <strong>Saturday, May 7, 9-11am</strong> – Sister Bay (Stabbur Beer Garden next to Al Johnson’s); <strong>Saturday, May 14, 9-11am</strong> – Egg Harbor, Main St Market; <strong>Saturday, May 21, 9-11am</strong> – Southern Door School. A limit of 3 items per household is requested. New members may join the Land Trust by making a donation of any amount on these days and receive a new member packet and Nature Notes calendar at the event.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">The native tree and plant give-away is a part of The Big Plant coordinated by the Climate Change Coalition of Door County. Through organizations partnering on The Big Plant, more than 5,000 trees will be planted.  Door County Land Trust chose to include pollinator-friendly perennial plants in their give-away so those with small properties or apartments would also be able to participate.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">“Whether you have a planter on a porch, a small backyard or several acres, you can plant something that helps native insects, birds and wildlife,” says Door County Land Trust director of charitable giving Cinnamon Rossman. “As these trees grow and flowers bloom, they’ll be a reminder of the things we can do to preserve and improve our environment.”</span>
