<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Wetland, Woodland, and Wild Land</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Protected in Southern Door County</strong></span></p>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Door County, WI</strong> – Door County Land Trust is pleased to announce the permanent protection of one mile of stream bank along Stony Creek in southern Door County. This is the first time a conservation organization has purchased land within the 13-mile Stony Creek stream corridor, the largest stream system in southern Door County, for the purpose of permanent conservation. Protection of this Stony Creek watershed and stream corridor may improve fish spawning habitat and ultimately improve the water quality flowing into Lake Michigan.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">The 43-acre newly preserved property contains a high quality forest filled with native white cedar, black ash, and white birch. The area near the creek is blanketed by ferns, including sensitive, cinnamon, and ostrich fern, which reach 6 feet tall in places. The creek itself provides important spawning habitat for fish.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">“The protection of this parcel is an important first step towards protecting fisheries habitat on Stony Creek,” Terrie Cooper, Door County Land Trust Community Conservation Director shares. “Ultimately, we hope to work with partners and landowners within this watershed to help protect the water quality flowing into Stony Creek and Lake Michigan. Clean water benefits us all.”</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">The property is a wooded refuge in a mostly agricultural area that supports Lake Michigan migratory birds. The property hosts a wide array of native plant and animal species both on the land and within the stream itself. Last winter, evidence was found of river otter slides on the steep slope to the creek.</span>
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Door County Land Trust plans to restore a small portion of the property, that was formerly in agriculture, to create a buffer of native plants that will help to lessen soil erosion and sedimentation in the creek, which can positively impact fish that may be found here.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Door County Land Trust thanks members and supporters for their contributions towards these conservation efforts. The purchase of this property was funded by Wisconsin’s Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Grant Program and a National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Sustain Our Great Lakes grant with funding from Crown Family Philanthropies and Caerus Foundation, Inc. A grant from the John C. Bock Foundation funds a portion of the Stewardship Endowment Fund contribution required for the long-term care of the property. Door County Land Trust seeks to raise additional endowment funds to ensure future care of the property.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Contributions to Door County Land Trust will help to fund the care of these properties and future land protection opportunities. To donate and support the conservation work of the Door County Land Trust, please visit www.DoorCountyLandTrust.org.</span>
