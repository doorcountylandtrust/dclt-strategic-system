Visionary landowners Nancy Aten and Dan Collins completed the donation of a 17-acre conservation easement to the Door County Land Trust this fall. The property, located near the 274-acre Bay Shore Blufflands Nature Preserve, adds to a complex of ecologically rich lands where several rare and threatened species have been identified. Waters from agricultural lands to the east are filtered through wetlands on the property before draining into the bay of Green Bay, resulting in cleaner freshwater and shoreline habitat.
Dan and Nancy pass their passion for nature on to the next generation as they share their knowledge and their land with grad students and grade-school students, visiting conservationists and backyard naturalists.
