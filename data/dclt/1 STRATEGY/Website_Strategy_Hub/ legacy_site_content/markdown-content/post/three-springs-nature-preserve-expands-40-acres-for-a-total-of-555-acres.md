Door County Land Trust is celebrating the protection of an additional 40 acres at Three Springs Nature Preserve! DCLT closed on the purchase last week, bringing the preserve’s total protected acreage to 555 and DCLT’s <strong>overall protected acreage to 9,943!</strong>

This wetland tract falls within the <strong>Three Springs Nature Preserve</strong> as well as the <strong>North Bay State Natural Area</strong> and is a vital link in the <strong><a href="https://www.wisconsinwetlands.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/North-Bay.pdf">North Bay wetland corridor</a></strong>, a conservation priority recognized by the Wisconsin DNR’s <strong><a href="https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/WildlifeHabitat/ActionPlan">Wildlife Action Plan</a></strong>. This acquisition strengthens a regional network of protected lands, contributing to a landscape-scale conservation strategy that supports water quality, habitat diversity, and climate resilience.

The protected property also lies within the <strong><a href="https://rsis.ramsar.org/ris/2218">Door Peninsula Coastal Wetlands Site</a></strong>, a Ramsar-designated area that includes a major section of the eastern Lake Michigan shoreline in northern Door County. All 11,443 acres within this site are permanently protected and managed for conservation, including <strong>Newport State Park, The Ridges Sanctuary, Mud Lake,</strong> and other properties overseen by Door County, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR)<strong>,</strong> and <strong>The Nature Conservancy</strong>.

The <strong>Ramsar List of Wetlands of International Importance</strong> includes over <strong>2,500 sites worldwide</strong>, forming the largest network of protected wetlands on the planet. This list is maintained by the <strong>Convention on Wetlands</strong>, whose mission is <strong>“the conservation and wise use of all wetlands through local and national actions and international cooperation, as a contribution towards achieving sustainable development throughout the world. </strong>To learn more about Ramsar, visit their <a href="https://www.ramsar.org">website</a>.
<blockquote><span style="color: #008000; font-size: 21px;">“This property is part of an ecologically valuable wetland system in Wisconsin,” said Emily Wood, Executive Director of the Door County Land Trust. “Preserving it not only protects habitat for rare species but also ensures that future generations will benefit from clean water and resilient natural landscapes.”</span></blockquote>
The new addition will be managed by DCLT as part of the Three Springs Nature Preserve, a conservation area known for its unique springs-fed wetlands, forested corridors, and intact hydrology. The Land Trust will:
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-size: 18px;">Protect and restore wetland habitat, ensuring healthy breeding grounds for fish and bird species.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-size: 18px;">Monitor and maintain water quality in Three Springs Creek, which flows into North Bay and Lake Michigan.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-size: 18px;">Manage invasive species and sustain native plant communities vital to local biodiversity.</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-size: 18px;">Provide public access for hiking, birdwatching, and passive nature enjoyment, in alignment with conservation goals (see the Three Springs Nature Preserve trail details <strong><a href="https://www.doorcountylandtrust.org/harold-c-wilson-three-springs-nature-preserve/">here</a></strong>).</span></li>
</ul>
DCLT prioritizes the acquisition of properties like this one to protect habitat for unique species such as spring peepers and the endangered Hine’s emerald dragonfly. These lands also safeguard the freshwater resources of Three Springs Creek, which eventually empties into North Bay—an essential spawning site for the <strong><a href="https://rsis.ramsar.org/RISapp/files/32224959/documents/US2218_lit1502.pdf">majority of Lake Michigan’s whitefish population</a></strong>. Additionally, these lands provide valuable stopover habitat for over 100 migratory bird species and support diverse plant communities that naturally adapt to the periodic rise and fall of lake water levels. Among these are high-quality natural plant communities, including emergent marsh and sedge meadow, which contribute to the region’s ecological integrity.

<strong>DCLT believes Door County is unlike anywhere else on Earth.</strong> Our supporting partners and members contribute to a legacy of conservation, protecting places that are not only special but <em>essential</em>.
