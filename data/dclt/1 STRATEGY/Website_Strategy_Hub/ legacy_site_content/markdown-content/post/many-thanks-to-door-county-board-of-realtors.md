The Door County Board of Realtors recently held a reception at Björklunden to honor retirees with more than ten years of service in the community. Ten realtors were recognized for their collective years of service. A tribute donation to the Door County Land Trust was made for each honoree.

We thank the Door County Board of Realtors for their gift and for their continued support of protecting the wild places and open spaces that make this an exceptional place in which to live and work.
