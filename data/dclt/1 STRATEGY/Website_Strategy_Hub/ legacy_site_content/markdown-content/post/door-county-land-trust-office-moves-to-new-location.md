The Door County Land Trust will be moving its office to a more expansive space at the newly developed Door County Epicenter at 217 N. 4<sup>th </sup>Avenue, Sturgeon Bay, the former home of Baylake Bank and Nicolet Bank, in June.  The organization’s need to increase staffing over the years to address important land protection and habitat restoration efforts necessitated the move.

According to director of charitable giving, Cinnamon Rossman, The Door County Land Trust Board of Directors and staff sees the new space as an opportunity to reuse, repurpose, and upcycle an existing building – with benefits that go beyond its square footage.

“We are pleased to occupy a central, easily-accessible location in downtown Sturgeon Bay,” she said. “Leasing enables the staff to focus on what’s most important right now—critical land protection opportunities and our responsibility to nurture wildlife and care for these protected lands.”

The Door County Epicenter for Commerce and Community is occupied by a variety of professional, retail, and service businesses with shared office and coworking spaces. Door County Land Trust will occupy about half of the second floor of the building. In addition to staff offices and meeting rooms, a multi-purpose meeting room provides space for the community to participate in volunteer activities, workshops, and other group activities.

Door County Land Trust offices will be closed to the public from June 13 - 20 to accommodate the move. Business will resume on Tuesday, June 21 at the Door County Epicenter. Door County Land Trust board and staff look forward to hosting an open-house event this autumn.

Door County Land Trust hiking maps, brochures, and publications will be available in the Door County Epicenter lobby. While visitors are welcome to drop in to the office, appointments are appreciated.
