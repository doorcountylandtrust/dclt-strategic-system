The Land Trust staff recently spent two days on Chambers Island working on activities related to the establishment of a 1,000-acre <em>Chambers Island Nature Preserve</em>. While many hours were spent walking through the magnificent forest on the island to evaluate properties the Land Trust is interested in acquiring and post boundary markers on the recently acquired 130-acre nucleus of the preserve, time was also spent talking with islanders and getting to know this unique island community better. With no electricity, no amenities and only "rustic" roads (that's putting it mildly!), visiting Chambers is like traveling back in time; a time when neighbors truly needed one another and if you happened to be in the neighborhood a cold beverage and something to eat would surely be offered. The dozens of Door County islands that surround the mainland are truly special places with high ecological importance. With concerted efforts ongoing on Chambers, Detroit and Washington islands, the Land Trust is working hard to preserve the beauty and integrity of these 'jewels in the lake.'
