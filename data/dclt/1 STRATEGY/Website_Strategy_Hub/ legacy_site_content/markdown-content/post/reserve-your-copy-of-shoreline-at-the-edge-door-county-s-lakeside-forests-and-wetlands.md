<span style="font-size: 14pt;">The above photo of Kangaroo Lake is one of  twenty aerialscapes photographed from an airplane by Paul M. Lurie featured in the new book, “A Shoreline at the Edge: Door County’s Lakeside Forests and Wetlands.” Through a generous donation from Paul Lurie, Door County Land Trust is making the book available for free to the community in an effort to inspire a greater love of the peninsula’s wilderness and to propel further conservation efforts across the peninsula, its islands, and surrounding waters.</span>
