<strong>A Commitment to Conservation</strong>

Ellison Bay property owner Michael Schmitz has taken a significant step toward preserving Door County’s natural beauty by completing conservation easement agreements on three parcels with the Door County Land Trust. The first agreement, finalized at the end of 2023, ensures that a four-acre parcel containing 600 feet of undeveloped Green Bay shoreline remains permanently protected. While Schmitz retains ownership of the land, the Land Trust holds the conservation easement, safeguarding the property’s ecological integrity for generations to come.

In a phone interview, Schmitz described the good feeling he gets each time he passes the property on his way home, knowing the landscape will be protected from development. He said, “I look at the trees, the birds, and whisper, ‘Enjoy it out there. No one is ever going to disturb you.’”

<strong>Protecting Valuable Ecosystems</strong>

After his initial easement agreement, Schmitz furthered his commitment to conservation by protecting two additional nearby parcels in March. Together, the two new parcels protect nearly 14 acres of mature mesic forest, bringing the total land under his conservation easement agreements to over 18 acres. The forest within these newly protected parcels features towering beech, sugar maple, hemlock, red oak, and white cedar trees. Situated close to Ellison Bluff County Park, these properties contribute to a larger wildlife corridor, allowing native species to move safely through their natural habitat.

Door County is home to a remarkable diversity of plant and animal life, thriving in unique and often rare ecosystems. Amidst the natural beauty, there’s a sense of history and belonging. Here, you’ll discover a unique rural charm and a tranquil rhythm of life. As development pressures increase, the role of private landowners in conservation becomes ever more crucial. Fragmentation of natural landscapes—caused by roads, buildings, and other infrastructure—threatens wildlife habitats and diminishes the region’s ecological and scenic value. Schmitz sees himself as a “temporary custodian of the land” with a duty to protect Door County, “a magnificent celebration of all the glories of nature.” He hopes his story will inspire other landowners to consider a conservation easement on their property.

When asked about his experience working with Drew and the Land Team, Schmitz described it as "educational," adding, "I had no idea the work it took." Schmitz values the time spent ensuring that legal opinions, research, and charitable deduction information for the IRS were handled correctly.

<strong>Inspiring Other Landowners</strong>

The conservation efforts of landowners like Michael Schmitz help ensure that Door County’s natural and rural character endures. By protecting these landscapes, they not only preserve wildlife habitat but also maintain the environmental and aesthetic qualities that attract residents and visitors alike. Thanks to Schmitz’s dedication, these special places will remain protected for generations to come.
