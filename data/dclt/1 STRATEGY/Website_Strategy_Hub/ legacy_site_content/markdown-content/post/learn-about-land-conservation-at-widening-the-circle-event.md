Executive director Tom Clay says, “Door County is a special place due to its incredible vistas, sweeping landscapes and wild places. Each of us who lives here and enjoys this wild beauty can be a part of helping to protect the land and water which sustain us.”

Hosted by board members and staff of the Land Trust, attendees will have the opportunity to gain an insider’s glimpse into the workings of the Land Trust. Staff members will share news of recent successes and upcoming projects, especially those which volunteers and members have helped to achieve. Following a short presentation, attendees are invited to join a hike led by director of land program Terrie Cooper at the Lautenbach Woods Nature Preserve.

Join us to find out how our local community is vital to protecting Door County’s exceptional lands and waters. Registration is $10 per person and may be applied towards a new membership or a gift membership.  Register by calling the Door County Land Trust at (920)746-1359 or online at <a href="http://www.DoorCountyLandTrust.org/circle">www.DoorCountyLandTrust.org/circle</a>.
