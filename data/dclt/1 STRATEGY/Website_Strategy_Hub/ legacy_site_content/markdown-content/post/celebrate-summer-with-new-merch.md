Door County Land Trust knows you love all things "Door County" and want to represent! There is no better way to show you care about the exceptional lands and waters of the Door peninsula than wearing DCLT merch. Your contribution to conserving what makes Door County special is rewarded with an organic cotton Trillium baseball cap, a soft cotton Heins emerald dragonfly tee printed in earth-friendly inks, and more! To get this new merchandise, <a href="https://www.doorcountylandtrust.org/gift-shop/">visit our gift shop</a>.

Baseball caps are currently being sold on preorder through August 31, meaning when you purchase one it is custom made for you.
