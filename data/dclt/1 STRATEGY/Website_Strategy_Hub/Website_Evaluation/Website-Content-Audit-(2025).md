# Website Content Audit (2025 Overview)

## Purpose
This audit captures the structure, scope, and quality of content from the **legacy DCLT website** prior to the 2025–2026 overhaul project.  
It is preserved here in Strategy for long-term reference and learning.

## Methods
- Full scrape of pages + posts exported into Markdown/TSV.  
- Manual review of **navigation, CTAs, readability, duplication**.  
- Snapshot screenshots of representative pages.  

## Key Findings (Summary Bullets)
- Content volume: XX pages, YY blog posts.  
- Duplicated messaging in About/News sections.  
- Limited CTAs on high-traffic pages (Donate buried).  
- Accessibility issues: small text, low contrast on older posts.
