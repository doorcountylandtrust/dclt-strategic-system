# Wireframe – Preserve Experience (Explore Section)

## Purpose
Design wireframes for the `/explore` section of the DCLT site.  
This includes the **Preserve Explorer map + list views**, detail page panels, filters, and supporting IA elements.  
Goal: a unified system that blends spatial exploration with accessible content discovery.

---

## Layout Overview
- **Explore Landing Page**
  - Hero intro text & CTA (“Discover the Preserves”)
  - Dual mode toggle: **Map View** vs **List View**
  - Filter bar (activity, accessibility, location proximity, etc.)
  - Quick stats (e.g., “10,000 acres protected” badge)

- **Map View**
  - Interactive map (Leaflet + OSM)
  - Pins for preserves
  - On-click: side panel overlay with preserve summary (photo, key tags, CTA to detail)

- **List View**
  - Grid or list of preserve cards
  - Each card shows name, short description, key tags (activities, accessibility)
  - “View on Map” link for each preserve

- **Preserve Detail (Panel)**
  - Photo gallery or hero image
  - Description block
  - CTA buttons: “Visit,” “Support,” “Learn More”
  - Accessibility notes
  - Related preserves or events

---

## Accessibility Notes
- Filters keyboard-accessible and screen-reader friendly
- Color contrast compliant
- Alt text and audio description hooks for images
- Panel overlays fully navigable without mouse

---

## Milestones
- 2025-10-05 — Draft Map + List View wireframes
- 2025-10-15 — Review with staff (Comms + Conservation)
- 2025-10-25 — Finalize preserve detail panel layouts
- 2025-11-01 — Align with Modular Content Blocks for consistency

---

## Dependencies
- Preserve content model (fields, tags, icons)
- UX decisions from [UX + Interaction Design Decisions Log]
- Brand system visual direction

---

## Notes
- Ensure tight integration with **Preserve Explorer Project Hub** and **Preserve IA (Overview & Routing)**.
- Consider future scalability for events + stewardship overlays.
- This wireframe phase is **strategy-first**; visual design comes later.
