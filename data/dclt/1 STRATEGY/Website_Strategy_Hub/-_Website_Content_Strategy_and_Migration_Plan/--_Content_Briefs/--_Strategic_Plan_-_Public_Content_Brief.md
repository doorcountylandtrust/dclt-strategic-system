# —— Strategic Plan – Public Content Brief

As researched in the [[—— Strategic Initiatives – Comms Summary|Strategic Initiatives – Comms Summary]]

## **🔥 Goal**

Translate the DCLT Strategic Initiatives into plain-language, public-facing content for use on the website and in campaigns. Focus on clarity, emotional resonance, and audience relevance—without internal jargon.
