# 📐 Wireframe Strategy – Contact Page

## Purpose
Visualize and plan the structure of the Contact section, ensuring clarity, accessibility, and alignment with DCLT’s communication goals.

## Wireframe Goals
- Clear entry point for all audiences to reach staff or submit inquiries  
- Prominent form and/or staff directory integration  
- Reduce friction by segmenting staff by department or function  
- Keep design clean, open, and trustworthy  

## Layout & Blocks
1. **Hero Block**  
   - Title: “Get in Touch”  
   - Subtitle: “We’d love to hear from you”  
   - Optional: background image of office or preserve  

2. **Contact Options Section**  
   - **Form Embed** (Formstack, Gravity, or Mailchimp form)  
   - **Quick Links Panel** (e.g., “Looking to Volunteer?”, “Press Inquiry?”, “General Question”)  

3. **Staff Directory Preview**  
   - Grid or list of key departments (Leadership, Conservation, Development, Comms)  
   - CTA to full `/contact/staff` page  

4. **Map + Office Info**  
   - Address + hours  
   - Simple embedded map block  

5. **FAQ Accordion (Optional)**  
   - “Who should I contact about volunteering?”  
   - “How do I make a donation?”  
   - “Where is your office located?”  

## Subpages
- **/contact** — Main hub (hero, form, directory preview, map)  
- **/contact/staff** — Full staff listing  
- **/contact/board (opt)** — Optional board directory  

## UX Notes
- Group staff directory by department/function for quick scanning  
- Place form above the fold (priority)  
- Provide fallback link if form embed fails  
- Consider CTA panel for alternate next steps  

## Next Steps
- Draft low-fidelity wireframe (desktop + mobile)  
- Review with stakeholders for functionality + accessibility  
- Finalize for integration into modular block system
