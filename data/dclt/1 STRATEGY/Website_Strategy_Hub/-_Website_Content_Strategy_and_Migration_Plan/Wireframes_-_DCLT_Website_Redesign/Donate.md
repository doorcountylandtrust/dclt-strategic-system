# Donate Page — Wireframe Strategy

## 🎯 Purpose
Translate the IA plan into a visual + functional structure that maximizes conversions for one-time, monthly, and legacy gifts. Wireframe should reflect urgency, trust, and flexibility in giving pathways.

---

## 🧩 Proposed Block Layout (Top → Bottom)

1. **Hero Block**
   - Impact message headline (e.g., *“Protect Door County Land Today”*)
   - CTA button: *Donate Now*
   - Background: conservation image

2. **Donation Options Panel**
   - Tabs or columns for:
     - One-time
     - Monthly
     - Legacy / Planned Giving
   - Secondary links for stock/IRA, tribute gifts

3. **Impact + Trust Section**
   - Statistic Panel (*“10,000 acres protected”*)
   - Testimonial Block (*supporter voices*)
   - Annual Report / Transparency links

4. **Accordion Block — FAQs**
   - Tax-deductibility
   - Privacy & security
   - Gift restrictions

5. **Featured Story (optional)**
   - Seasonal campaign story, linked to campaign subpage

6. **Footer CTA Panel**
   - Reinforce urgency (*“Give Now to Protect What You Love”*)

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Audience Flow

- **General supporters**: Hero → Donation Options Panel → Impact proof → Donate
- **Major donors**: Scroll further for Legacy / stock/IRA options
- **Recurring prospects**: Nudged via Monthly Giving section
- **Reviewers**: Find credibility through Testimonials + Reports

---

## 📎 Subpage Wireframes Needed
- `/donate/monthly` — Recurring giving focus
- `/donate/legacy` — Legacy/estate giving pathways
- `/donate/campaign` — Seasonal or urgent campaign landing
- `/donate/faq` — Optional detailed questions

---

## 📝 Notes
- Campaign subpages should be easily swapped in/out seasonally.
- Consistency of CTA placement across all giving pages.
- Ensure accessibility and mobile-first layouts for donation forms.
- Consider A/B testing different hero messages for conversion.
