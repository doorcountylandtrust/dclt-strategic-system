How often do we get the chance to contribute to collective efforts spanning the <em>entire globe</em>? The scope of the <strong>Great Backyard Bird Count</strong> is just one of many features that make this annual campaign so cool. If you have never participated in a citizen science project, you may discover many great reasons to get involved.

<strong><a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/citizen-science-article/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Citizen science</a></strong> is the practice of public participation and collaboration in scientific research to increase scientific knowledge. In the case of the Great Backyard Bird Count, this means watching for birds for at least fifteen minutes in a location and submitting what birds you see or hear to the count. This annual event occurs before Spring migration begins in the US (where the event originated) and the observations made during this time help scientists better understand global bird populations. The GBBC is a great way to connect with nature, even from the comfort of home if you can view birds through a window. This fun event offers opportunities to observe the lively habits of our feathered friends. You may want to bring a camera and practice nature photography, and invite family members young and old to join in! You can learn about birds world-wide and view the <strong><a href="https://ebird.org/gbbc/livesubs?__hstc=64079792.ab5f0d844d0402aaea31e0abed8afbc2.1738164312797.1738186300527.1738189768607.3&amp;__hssc=64079792.3.1738189768607&amp;__hsfp=3610251684&amp;_gl=1*4db2xw*_gcl_au*ODI5NzU0OTYxLjE3MzgxNjQzMTE.*_ga*MTc0NDkwODE0NC4xNzM4MTY0MzEy*_ga_QR4NVXZ8BM*MTczODE4OTc2Ny4zLjEuMTczODE5MDMzMy42MC4wLjA.&amp;_ga=2.268415438.1378674790.1738164312-1744908144.1738164312" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live map</a></strong> light up with bird count submissions on the <strong><a href="https://www.birdcount.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GBBC website.</a></strong>
