The value of property is often summed up in the words “location, location, location”.  That saying holds true for the ecological value of the location of Door County Land Trust’s recent land purchase within Gibraltar-Ephraim Swamp Natural Area. The land is prized for its proximity to a migratory bird route and its coastal wetlands.

“Gibraltar-Ephraim Swamp Natural Area is part of an important wilderness corridor connecting Peninsula State Park and the WI DNR’s Mud Lake Wildlife Area,” said Land Program Director Jesse Koyen. “In addition to allowing the movement of wildlife across the landscape at a local level, this area provides important migratory bird habitat. Its proximity to their migration route, combined with high-quality habitat, allows migrating birds an ideal place to seek shelter, rest, and refuel.”

Door County Land Trust began protection efforts in Gibraltar-Ephraim Swamp with a conservation easement agreement 19 years ago and now protects over 400 acres in the swamp. The Land Trust plans continued conservation efforts in the area to protect the Gibraltar-Ephraim Swamp wetlands and surrounding forest areas.

Gibraltar-Ephraim Swamp is one of Door County’s largest coastal wetlands. The area contains mature cedar and open hardwood swamps. Running through the property are Ephraim and Hidden Springs Creeks. The recently purchased property lies between these waterways. These creek corridors offer the added ecological benefits of providing more diversity to foraging possibilities for many species and a positive influence on water quality in Ephraim’s Eagle Harbor.

The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) recognizes the coastal wetlands of Gibraltar-Ephraim Swamp among the most important wildlife habitat and natural landscapes in Door County. The protection of habitats like these rank as a top priority not only for the Land Trust, but also conservation partners within the Great Lakes region.

“The Land Trust is targeting areas where we can reconnect fragmented habitat,” said Door County Land Trust Executive Director Emily Wood. “It's a process much like assembling a complex puzzle, where each piece represents a critical step towards the larger goal of a thriving, intact ecosystem. It’s a gradual but profoundly impactful journey towards a more resilient and biodiverse Door County."

This purchase of the new addition to the Gibraltar-Ephraim Swamp Natural Area is funded in part by the Fox River Natural Resource Trustee Council, a tentative grant award from Wisconsin's Knowles Nelson Stewardship Fund, and remaining expenses funded by Land Trust supporters and the community. The Land Trust’s 2024 Conservation and Stewardship Campaign is generously sponsored by a matching challenge grant. Every donation to the campaign will be matched dollar-for-dollar, making donations go twice as far for conservation.
