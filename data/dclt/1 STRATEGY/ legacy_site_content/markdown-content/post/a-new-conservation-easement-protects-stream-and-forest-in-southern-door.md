<span class="MainText" style="font-size: 14pt;">While "looking for a campground" Ann and John Bladholm discovered a 40-acre woodland nestled along Claybanks Creek in Southern Door County.  There, John and Ann would spend many years, loving the land and exposing their children and countless guests to the wonders of nature. In an effort to protect the land's precious natural state and to honor its historic integrity, John and Ann donated a conservation easement to Door County Land Trust. </span>

<span class="MainText" style="font-size: 14pt;">"The Bladholms are habitat heroes," said Tom Clay, Door County Land Trust Executive Director.  "They loved and nurtured their land for more than a half century and now they have protected that same parcel for centuries to come," Clay said.</span>
