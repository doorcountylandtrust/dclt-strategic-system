<strong>Door County, WI – </strong>Over 47 acres along the Ahnapee River in the Town of Forestville are now permanently protected by Door County Land Trust thanks to our most recent land acquisition. On February 5<sup>th</sup> the Land Trust completed the purchase of this ecologically significant property which is comprised mostly of emergent marsh, and includes river and streambank, wetlands, and a small former hayfield.

The environment supports birds such as yellow warblers, soras, and green herons, and fish species such as pike, rainbow and brown trout. DCLT will manage the property to support watershed health, including water quality monitoring and wetland habitat restoration.

The previous landowner expressed appreciation that the land will remain in its natural state, ensuring its ecological integrity for future generations.

<strong>A conservation corridor for wildlife</strong>

The newly protected property is part of the Ahnapee River Wildlife Corridor, a vital habitat of wetlands and riverbank that follows the river from its headwaters near the Brussels hill to its mouth on Lake Michigan. The area supports migrating and nesting birds, fish habitats and diverse plant life. Conservation efforts along the Ahnapee River help sustain these ecological connections, ensuring that critical wildlife passageways remain intact. Wildlife corridors are threatened worldwide by fragmentation and human development.

<strong>Public access and the Ahnapee State Trail</strong>

Notably, the land acquisition enhances opportunities for public access, as the Ahnapee State Trail (Ice Age Trail) runs along the property. Outdoor enthusiasts, including hikers and hunters, will continue to enjoy the scenic views of this wetland habitat. The property can be accessed from the Ahnapee trail and road but does not have a parking lot.

&nbsp;

<strong>Funding and community support</strong>

Acquisition and management of this land were made possible by the generous support of donors and conservation funders who believe in DCLT’s mission to protect the region’s exceptional lands and waters. Funding for the purchase price of this land is awarded by Wisconsin DNR’s Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Program and anticipated support from the federal North American Wetlands Conservation Act (NAWCA). Donations from DCLT members and a grant through the Door County Community Foundation are helping to ensure the long-term protection and stewardship of the property.
