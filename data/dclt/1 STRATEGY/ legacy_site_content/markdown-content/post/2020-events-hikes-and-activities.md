<span style="font-size: 14pt;">From colorful wildflowers blooming across the peninsula to the calming roll of Lake Michigan waves on the shore, Door County has shed its winter coat and is buzzing with new life and summertime sunshine.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Normally, this is the time for exploring preserve trails through a guided hike, gathering together at events, or celebrating community conservation work to protect Door County’s wild places.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">However, during this time of uncertainty we are pausing our in-person event plans for the remainder of the year. We look forward to welcoming new and familiar friends at events in the future. For now,<a href="https://www.doorcountylandtrust.org/about-us/contact-us/"> sign up for email updates</a> on hikes, events, and other gatherings.</span>
