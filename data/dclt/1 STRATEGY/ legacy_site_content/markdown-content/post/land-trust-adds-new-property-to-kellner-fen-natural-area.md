Door County Land Trust has recently added another protected property to its project area at Kellner Fen Natural Area in Sturgeon Bay. The 12-acre parcel protects a perennial unnamed stream—whose protection contributes to local water quality—as well as wetlands and forest.

The new property is in keeping with the Land Trust’s 20-year focus of enlarging the preservation of the untouched, unique ecology of the land surrounding the fen. The long-term strategy is to conserve properties that will eventually connect to protect a larger wildlife corridor. The newly protected acreage is such a piece, located just north of the Kellner Fen Natural Area. Today, the Land Trust protects nearly 400 acres surrounding the fen.

“By protecting surrounding land, even if it doesn't abut it, you’re extending the conservation benefits of the land we already protect,” said Land Program Director Jesse Koyen. “Birds and other wildlife within the fen are able to disperse to this newly protected property due to its proximity.”

With the existence of a stream, the newly protected property likely shares a groundwater connection to Kellner Fen. The creek flows from its headwaters north of highway TT to the waters of Lake Michigan. According to Koyen, the existence of the creek by itself would make the property worthy of conservation as a stand-alone project. “Protection of the surface water is a safeguard for water quality in the area and provides important fish habitat,” he said.

Kellner Fen Natural Area features a rare type of wetland with a large expanse of open water and an extensive, fragile sedge mat that floats on top of the underlying water. The area protects several rare species including carnivorous plants and the federally endangered Hine’s emerald dragonfly. Like the newly protected property, the fen and its surrounding dense forests provide important refuge and foraging opportunities for migratory and nesting birds.

“When the For Sale sign appeared on this property, our office was flooded with calls from the community letting us know that they hoped to see this corner lot stay wild and undeveloped. We were certainly happy to be able to do so,” said Executive Director Emily Wood.

The purchase of the property was assisted by grants from the NRDA and Knowles-Nelson, which covered 50% of the cost. Purchase price of the land, associated costs, and long-term stewardship are to be fulfilled by private donations through the Land Trust’s 2024 Conservation and Stewardship Campaign. Now that the land is protected, the work to care for the habitat begins. Stewardship goals for the new property include removing invasive species to allow space for native species to thrive.

Current land projects at Kellner Fen wouldn’t be possible without a significant donation to the Land Acquisition fund made by Xan and John Fischer, who presented a matching gift challenge to the community in 2023.
