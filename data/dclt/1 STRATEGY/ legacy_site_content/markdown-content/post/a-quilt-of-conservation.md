Nearly four decades ago, a group of visionary conservationists came together with a shared mission: to protect Door County’s exceptional lands and waters forever. Comprised of volunteers, Door County Land Trustees was incorporated alongside the donation of the first conservation easement in 1986. Today, their mission lives on. Just one week before Earth Day, Door County Land Trust quietly reached a monumental milestone—<strong>more than 10,000 acres of land protected for conservation</strong>. The milestone was officially reached with the addition of a conservation easement donated by landowner James Gearen of Ellison Bay, protecting a 31-acre parcel along the Niagara Escarpment.

<strong>A Quilt of Conservation</strong>

Door County Land Trust now safeguards a greater expanse of land than all five Door County State Parks, which encompasses Peninsula, Whitefish Dunes, Potawatomi, Newport, and Rock Island State Parks. This makes the land trust the largest land protection organization in Door County. This milestone is more than a measure of acres—it represents decades of collective community effort to safeguard Door County’s iconic lands and waters.

&nbsp;

The “quilt” of land trust protection is stitched together through donated conservation easement agreements from landowners, partner projects with local governments and conservation organizations, and strategic land acquisitions by DCLT made possible by donors and grants. Conservation easements – property that remains private but has permanently restricted the type and amount of future development that can take place – make up about 40% of DCLT-protected land.  DCLT-owned properties include 15 nature preserves with trails and other public infrastructure, and natural areas that are protected for ecological value. This patchwork creates corridors for wildlife – which also provide areas for hiking, birdwatching, and hunting – and unique plant communities, where a child may discover a special flower or tree that sparks a love for nature. Also protected in the 10,000 acres are life-giving waterways, scenic open space, and the rural landscapes that characterize Door County.

&nbsp;

Quilting traditions trace back to a time when life was simpler but also filled with hardships. On winter nights, families would gather around the fireplace, sewing scraps of fabric into blankets using intricate stitching techniques, which developed into the patterns we recognize today. Quilting has endured through generations as both a craft and a symbol of care and resilience. In a similar way, people who lend time and resources to protect Door County carry forward a tradition of conservation built on dedication and the hope of passing along this ethos to future generations. Supporters of the land trust may give because of a sense of duty to steward the peninsula they grew up visiting, for protection of ecologically significant areas that are like nowhere else, or for the trail they frequent to remain accessible to future souls that, like themselves, seek renewal in nature.

<strong>Accelerating Conservation Efforts</strong>

As Door County faces rapid development, the land trust looks ahead with hopes to accelerate conservation efforts. “Cape Cod has roughly 30% of its land under permanent protection, which sets a powerful example of what's possible,” says Emily Wood, executive director of the Land Trust. “Across all of Door County—often called the Cape Cod of the Midwest—we're at just 11%, even when you combine state parks, county parks, state natural areas, and lands protected by our conservation partners like The Nature Conservancy, The Ridges Sanctuary, and Crossroads. There's still so much work to do to protect the wild places that define our landscape and our way of life."  Each time a large parcel is subdivided, or developed, a piece of productive habitat is potentially lost —and with it, the strength and resilience of the entire natural system is diminished.

<strong>Add Your Stitch: $10,000 Fundraiser Campaign</strong>

Your support helps this quilt of conservation grow. Like quilting traditions passed through generations, this milestone carries the hope that new hands will join in the Land Trust’s work. Every protected acre demands ongoing care—monitoring, removing invasive species, preventing encroachments, maintaining trails, and restoring habitats, among many other efforts. You can help move the mission forward to ensure the county’s natural treasures aren’t lost over time. Now is the time to take action to protect what is cherished, before more of these special places are lost forever. Protecting the future of Door County won’t happen by accident. It requires commitment, intentional action, and resources now.

&nbsp;

“The scale of conservation success in Door County truly reflects the depth of support from those who live, work, and play here,” said charitable giving director Cinnamon Rossman. “Door County’s beauty and natural character inspire a deep love, and it is thanks to the generosity of thousands of people who give back that this cherished place can be protected for generations to come.”

<strong>You can join in celebrating the preservation of 10,000 acres by helping to raise $10,000 for continued conservation efforts. As a reward, limited-edition organic cotton tote bags are being released on pre-order to donors who contribute $100 or more to this fundraising campaign. The design features six of Door County’s woodland ephemeral flowers, including the recognizable Trillium, and lesser-known early bloomers like Bloodroot and Trout Lily. Use the form below to make your donation today and select your style of tote! Campaign ends May 31, 2025.</strong>
