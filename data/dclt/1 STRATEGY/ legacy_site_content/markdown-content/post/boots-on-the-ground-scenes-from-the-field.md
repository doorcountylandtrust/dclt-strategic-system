Chatting with our Seasonal Stewardship Assistant, Maykaylee Kuhn

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Lucy:</strong></span> <strong>Describe your favorite project you worked on this summer. What made it enjoyable?</strong>

<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Makaylee:</strong> </span>I have two answers for this haha! Here they are :)
--Kestrel banding with Jeep Pagel: This was such a cool and unique experience being able to help Jeep band some of the kestrel chicks on one of our nature preserves. I was able to hold a few chicks and help determine their gender while Jeep educated us about the species and told us stories from his life as a bird bander. It was an exciting opportunity to do something new and gain some valuable experience – especially in a field of study that I had never been a part of before!
--Chambers Island trip: In early August, we were able to take a trip out to Chambers Island to help monitor phragmites and garlic mustard on DCLT property. This was a very full-circle moment for me since my grandparents had been lighthouse keepers on the island for 47 years and I had spent many summers with my family out on the island. We were able to kayak the entirety of Lake Mackaysee while looking for phragmites and spotted a bald eagle! It was wonderful to spend the day with some of the islanders, like my great uncle and some other family friends, and be able to discuss the Land Trust’s work and mission with them in a place near and dear to my heart.

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Lucy:</strong> </span><strong>Tell a story of a day or project that was memorable (good or bad experience).</strong>

<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Makaylee:</strong></span> Around my second or third week of the season, I was driving back to the office one day when I felt a tick attached to the outer part of my ear. I was freaking out a bit when I walked into the office, but thankfully Jesse (along with the help and support of Emily, Carrie, and Kristi) was able to jump into dad mode and help remove the tick with a cool, counter-clockwise Q-tip maneuver. Of course, as I was a bit disgusted and stressed, they were in awe of how the tick had climbed up into the fold of my ear and were admiring how cute the little guy was. It was a memorable experience and humorous start to the season!

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Lucy:</strong></span><strong> Give a few reasons why you think Door County is special/worth protecting.</strong>

<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Makaylee:</strong> </span>Before I started at DCLT, I knew that Door County was a special place after spending every summer here with my family throughout my life. For years I had been able to enjoy the beaches, parks, hikes, and other places that made Door County a one-of-a-kind location. However, I wasn’t fully aware of how many truly unique places and ecosystems were here that I had never seen or experienced before. Door County is such a diverse and beautiful place, which is both a blessing and a curse at times. Even in the past 20+ years that I have lived here, I have witnessed numerous changes and developments due to increased tourism and overall growth. While many people think of Door County as a vacation, recreation, or shopping destination, this place would truly not be the same without its natural habitats and the species that call these places home. I have seen firsthand how important these communities are to the county and its livelihood. Now, more than ever before, I realize how vitally important it is for us to continue to protect the landscapes and ecosystems that make Door County our home.

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Lucy:</strong> </span><strong>What was the most important project you worked on this summer?</strong>

<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Makaylee:</strong> </span>One of the most important projects I worked on this summer was the prairie restoration at Legacy Nature Preserve at Clay Banks. This restoration was honestly one of our largest and most grueling tasks this summer, but our hard work has definitely paid off. Over the course of multiple weeks (and numerous 8-hour days with 30-pound backpack sprayers on our backs), we were able to treat various invasive species throughout the prairie and have now witnessed the renewed growth and success of our native species in this area. If you take a walk through Legacy, you can physically see the drastic changes that have occurred. It is now becoming a beautiful, flourishing habitat that we will continue to improve and protect for years to come.

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Lucy:</strong> </span><strong>Describe your experience overall working for DCLT this summer.</strong>

<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Makaylee:</strong></span> My experience working for DCLT this summer has been nothing short of transformative. All the DCLT staff members have been so welcoming and supportive of me in this new role, and I could not be more grateful. It has been such an eye-opening experience for me being able to witness firsthand what the Land Trust is all about and being able to discover so many wonderful new places while gaining valuable experience in this field. Although there were some long, tiring days spent in the heat of the summer, it was all worth it being able to be a part of the work and success of such an important and invaluable organization. No matter where my path takes me next, I truly hope that one day I can return to help the Land Trust continue its work in whatever way possible.

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>THANK YOU</strong> </span><strong>to Makaylee for your hard work this year, and for sharing your stories! And shout out to Alanna, our Seasonal Restoration Assistant, for being a rockstar this season too! Thank you both!</strong>
