<span data-contrast="auto">The recent purchase of 77 acres near the Hibbard Creek Natural Area aligns with the Land Trust’s goal to extend protection in wildlife corridors that provide for movement across the landscape. These corridors are crucial for the survival of animal species as they provide new home territories for breeding and the foraging of food. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">Along with the protected Erskine Woods and Solitude Natural Areas, Hibbard Creek Natural Area is within the Hibbard Creek watershed west of Kangaroo Lake. The watershed plays an important role in water quality as it contains Hibbard Creek—the longest stream north of Sturgeon Bay that transverses the peninsula. The watershed contains feeder streams, bordering wetlands, and woodlands that follow Hibbard Creek and filter surface water on its way into Lake Michigan. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">A closer look under the creek’s rocks reveals the base of the watershed food chain. The native plants and aquatic insects feed spawning pike, rainbow and brook trout.  The wetlands and woodlands provide food and shelter for rich populations of species including migratory birds like the Sandhill Crane, insects such as the brown-belted bumble bee and monarch butterfly, and mammals such as the porcupine and gray fox.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">“As more development takes place within the corridor and along the creek bed, we have an urgent need to do what we can to protect its water quality and wildlife while we still can,” said Executive Director Emily Wood. “We are pleased to add significant protected acreage to the Hibbard Creek Natural Area and the watershed overall.” </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>

<span data-contrast="auto">The purchase of this newly protected property is supported by donations from the community, and through</span><span data-contrast="auto"> grant funding provided in part by WI-Department of Natural Resource Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Program, and the Fox River and Green Bay Trustees Natural Resources Damage Assessment Fund</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>
