# :: North Star Metrics + Measurement Philosophy

*A framework to guide how we define, measure, and interpret communications and engagement success across brand, website, and donor experience.*

---

## 🌟 Purpose of This Page

To identify the most meaningful indicators of progress and impact — rooted in mission, not just marketing convention — so we can:

- Make informed, values-aligned decisions
- Prioritize improvements that matter
- Communicate success clearly to internal and external audiences

---

## 🧭 Guiding Principles

1. **Mission-Aligned Over Vanity Metrics**
    - It’s more valuable to deepen trust than to chase clicks.
2. **Lagging + Leading Indicators**
    - We track both final outcomes and early signals of momentum.
3. **Qualitative + Quantitative**
    - Storytelling and metrics reinforce each other.
4. **Comparability Over Time**
    - Metrics should allow for trend analysis, not just snapshots.

## 🧠 Our North Star Metrics

| Category | Metric | Why It Matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Relationship Health** | Repeat donor rate | Trust, satisfaction, and mission alignment |
|  | Time-to-second-gift | Measures resonance and momentum |
|  | Email engagement rate (opened + clicked) | Signal of relevance and clarity |
| **Reach & Engagement** | New supporters added (by segment) | Growth of our movement |
|  | Event RSVPs / attendance rate | Activation of values-aligned interest |
|  | Volunteer sign-ups by persona cluster | Mission-connected engagement |
| **Message Resonance** | “Most memorable message” survey response | Tests clarity and emotional power |
|  | CTA conversion by message type | Tests which lenses (ecological, emotional, economic) work best |
| **Process & Team** | Staff ease-of-use with tools | Internal efficiency and adoption |
|  | On-time content publication | Project management health |

---

## 📊 Secondary Metrics We Monitor

- Web traffic (unique visitors, time on page, bounce rate)
- Social shares and comments
- Survey completion rates
- List growth rate
- Campaign-specific ROI (e.g., cost-per-acquisition)

---

## 📌 Interpretation Notes

- We don’t expect all metrics to trend up at once.
- Some “drops” may indicate strategic refinement (e.g., list cleaning).
- Contextual notes will always accompany dashboard views.

## 🔄 Measurement Cadence

| Frequency | Metric Types |
| --- | --- |
| Monthly | Email, web traffic, content calendar progress |
| Quarterly | Donor trends, repeat giving, engagement by segment |
| Annually | Brand perception, supporter journey audit, campaign ROI |
